chapter_3	but by dint of much and earnest contemplation and oft repeat pondering and especially by throw open the little window towards the back of the entry -PRON- at last come to the conclusion that such an idea however wild may not be altogether unwarranted
chapter_3	yet be there a sort of indefinite half attain unimaginable sublimity about -PRON- that fairly freeze -PRON- to -PRON- till -PRON- involuntarily take an oath with -PRON- to find out what that marvellous painting mean

chapter_3	with this once long lance now wildly elbow fifty year ago do nathan swain kill fifteen whale between a sunrise and a sunset
chapter_3	and that harpoon so like a corkscrew now be flung in javan sea and run away with by a whale year afterwards slay off the cape of blanco
chapter_3	the original iron enter nigh the tail and like a restless needle sojourning in the body of a man travel full forty foot and at last be find imbed in the hump
chapter_3	crossing this dusky entry and on through yon low arched way cut through what in old time must have be a great central chimney with fireplace all round -PRON- enter the public room
chapter_3	a still dusky place be this with such low ponderous beam above and such old wrinkled plank beneath that -PRON- would almost fancy -PRON- tread some old craft 's cockpit especially of such a howling night when this corner anchor old ark rock so furiously
chapter_3	on one side stand a long low shelf like table cover with crack glass case fill with dusty rarity gather from this wide world 's remote nook
chapter_3	be that how -PRON- may there stand the vast arched bone of the whale 's jaw so wide a coach may almost drive beneath -PRON-
chapter_3	within be shabby shelf range round with old decanter bottle flask and in those jaw of swift destruction like another curse jonah by which name indeed -PRON- call -PRON- bustle a little withered old man who for -PRON- money dearly sell the sailor delirium and death

chapter_3	-PRON- observe however that one of -PRON- hold somewhat aloof and though -PRON- seem desirous not to spoil the hilarity of -PRON- shipmate by -PRON- own sober face yet upon the whole -PRON- refrain from make as much noise as the rest
chapter_3	-PRON- stand full six foot in height with noble shoulder and a chest like a coffer dam
chapter_3	-PRON- face be deeply brown and burn make -PRON- white tooth dazzle by the contrast while in the deep shadow of -PRON- eye float some reminiscence that do not seem to give -PRON- much joy
chapter_3	-PRON- voice at once announce that -PRON- be a southerner and from -PRON- fine stature -PRON- think -PRON- must be one of those tall mountaineer from the alleghanian ridge in virginia
chapter_3	when the revelry of -PRON- companion have mount to -PRON- height this man slip away unobserved and -PRON- see no more of -PRON- till -PRON- become -PRON- comrade on the sea
chapter_3	in a few minute however -PRON- be miss by -PRON- shipmate and be -PRON- seem for some reason a huge favourite with -PRON- -PRON- raise a cry of bulkington bulkington where be bulkington and dart out of the house in pursuit of -PRON-
chapter_3	no man prefer to sleep two in a bed
chapter_3	in fact -PRON- would a good deal rather not sleep with -PRON- own brother
chapter_3	and when -PRON- come to sleep with an unknown stranger in a strange inn in a strange town and that strange a harpooneer then -PRON- objection indefinitely multiply
chapter_3	nor be there any earthly reason why -PRON- as a sailor should sleep two in a bed more than anybody else for sailor no more sleep two in a bed at sea than bachelor king do ashore
chapter_3	to be sure -PRON- all sleep together in one apartment but -PRON- have -PRON- own hammock and cover -PRON- with -PRON- own blanket and sleep in -PRON- own skin
chapter_3	-PRON- be fair to presume that be a harpooneer -PRON- linen or woollen as the case may be would not be of the tidy certainly none of the fine
chapter_3	-PRON- begin to twitch all over
chapter_3	besides -PRON- be get late and -PRON- decent harpooneer ought to be home and go bedward

chapter_3	
chapter_3	just as -PRON- please -PRON- be sorry -PRON- can not spare ye a tablecloth for a mattress and -PRON- be a plaguy rough board here feeling of the knot and notch
chapter_3	but wait a bit skrimshander -PRON- have get a carpenter 's plane there in the bar
chapter_3	so say -PRON- procure the plane and with -PRON- old silk handkerchief first dust the bench vigorously set to plan away at -PRON- bed the while grin like an ape
chapter_3	-PRON- now take the measure of the bench and find that -PRON- be a foot too short but that could be mend with a chair
chapter_3	so there be no yoke -PRON-
chapter_3	but -PRON- soon find that there come such a draught of cold air over -PRON- from under the sill of the window that this plan would never do at all especially as another current from the rickety door meet the one from the window and both together form a series of small whirlwind in the immediate vicinity of the spot where -PRON- have think to spend the night
chapter_3	-PRON- seem no bad idea but upon second thought -PRON- dismiss -PRON-
chapter_3	for who could tell but what the next morning so soon as -PRON- pop out of the room the harpooneer may be stand in the entry all ready to knock -PRON- down
chapter_3	think
chapter_3	-PRON- will have a good look at -PRON- then and perhaps -PRON- may become jolly good bedfellow after all
chapter_3	there be no telling
chapter_3	but though the other boarder keep come in by one two and three and go to bed yet no sign of -PRON- harpooneer

chapter_3	may be not take out a stick and whittle a toothpick but -PRON- rayther guess -PRON- will be do brown if that ere harpooneer hear -PRON- a slanderin -PRON- head
chapter_3	-PRON- will break -PRON- for -PRON- say -PRON- now fly into a passion again at this unaccountable farrago of the landlord 's
chapter_3

chapter_3	and about this harpooneer whom -PRON- have not yet see -PRON- persist in tell -PRON- the most mystifying and exasperating story tend to beget in -PRON- an uncomfortable feeling towards the man whom -PRON- design for -PRON- bedfellow a sort of connexion landlord which be an intimate and confidential one in the high degree
chapter_3	-PRON- now demand of -PRON- to speak out and tell -PRON- who and what this harpooneer be and whether -PRON- shall be in all respect safe to spend the night with -PRON-
chapter_3	and in the first place -PRON- will be so good as to unsay that story about sell -PRON- head which if true -PRON- take to be good evidence that this harpooneer be stark mad and -PRON- have no idea of sleep with a madman and -PRON- sir you -PRON- mean landlord you sir by try to induce -PRON- to do so knowingly would thereby render -PRON- liable to a criminal prosecution
chapter_3

chapter_3	do come won't ye come
chapter_3	-PRON- consider the matter a moment and then up stair -PRON- go and -PRON- be usher into a small room cold as a clam and furnished sure enough with a prodigious bed almost big enough indeed for any four harpooneer to sleep abreast
chapter_3	-PRON- turn round from eye the bed but -PRON- have disappear
chapter_3	though none of the most elegant -PRON- yet stand the scrutiny tolerably well
chapter_3	-PRON- then glance round the room and besides the bedstead and centre table could see no other furniture belong to the place but a rude shelf the four wall and a papered fireboard represent a man strike a whale
chapter_3	likewise there be a parcel of outlandish bone fish hook on the shelf over the fire place and a tall harpoon stand at the head of the bed
chapter_3	but what be this on the chest
chapter_3	-PRON- take -PRON- up and hold -PRON- close to the light and feel -PRON- and smell -PRON- and try every way possible to arrive at some satisfactory conclusion concern -PRON-
chapter_3	there be a hole or slit in the middle of this mat as -PRON- see the same in south american poncho
chapter_3	but could -PRON- be possible that any sober harpooneer would get into a door mat and parade the street of any christian town in that sort of guise
chapter_3	-PRON- put -PRON- on to try -PRON- and -PRON- weigh -PRON- down like a hamper be uncommonly shaggy and thick and -PRON- think a little damp as though this mysterious harpooneer have be wear -PRON- of a rainy day

chapter_3	-PRON- tear -PRON- out of -PRON- in such a hurry that -PRON- give -PRON- a kink in the neck
chapter_3	-PRON- sit down on the side of the bed and commence think about this head peddle harpooneer and -PRON- door mat
chapter_3	after think some time on the bed side -PRON- get up and take off -PRON- monkey jacket and then stand in the middle of the room thinking
chapter_3	-PRON- then take off -PRON- coat and think a little more in -PRON- shirt sleeve
chapter_3	but begin to feel very cold now half undressed as -PRON- be and remember what the landlord say about the harpooneer be not come home at all that night -PRON- be so very late -PRON- make no more ado but jump out of -PRON- pantaloon and boot and then blow out the light tumble into bed and commend -PRON- to the care of heaven
chapter_3	whether that mattress be stuff with corn cob or broken crockery there be no telling but -PRON- roll about a good deal and could not sleep for a long time
chapter_3	at last -PRON- slide off into a light doze and have pretty nearly make a good offing towards the land of nod when -PRON- hear a heavy footfall in the passage and see a glimmer of light come into the room from under the door
chapter_3	lord save -PRON- think -PRON- that must be the harpooneer the infernal head peddler
chapter_3	but -PRON- lay perfectly still and resolve not to say a word till speak to
chapter_3	hold a light in one hand and that identical new zealand head in the other the stranger enter the room and without look towards the bed place -PRON- candle a good way off from -PRON- on the floor in one corner and then begin work away at the knotted cord of the large bag -PRON- before speak of as be in the room

chapter_3	-PRON- remember a story of a white man a whaleman too who fall among the cannibal have be tattooed by -PRON-
chapter_3	-PRON- conclude that this harpooneer in the course of -PRON- distant voyage must have meet with a similar adventure
chapter_3	and what be -PRON- think -PRON- after all
chapter_3	-PRON- be only -PRON- outside a man can be honest in any sort of skin
chapter_3	but then what to make of -PRON- unearthly complexion that part of -PRON- -PRON- mean lie round about and completely independent of the square of tattooing
chapter_3	to be sure -PRON- may be nothing but a good coat of tropical tanning but -PRON- never hear of a hot sun 's tan a white man into a purplish yellow one
chapter_3	however -PRON- have never be in the south seas and perhaps the sun there produce these extraordinary effect upon the skin
chapter_3	now while all these idea be pass through -PRON- like lightning this harpooneer never notice -PRON- at all
chapter_3	but after some difficulty have open -PRON- bag -PRON- commence fumble in -PRON- and presently pull out a sort of tomahawk and a seal skin wallet with the hair on
chapter_3	-PRON- now take off -PRON- hat a new beaver hat when -PRON- come nigh sing out with fresh surprise
chapter_3	there be no hair on -PRON- head none to speak of at least nothing but a small scalp knot twist up on -PRON- forehead
chapter_3	-PRON- bald purplish head now look for all the world like a mildewed skull
chapter_3	have not the stranger stand between -PRON- and the door -PRON- would have bolt out of -PRON- quicker than ever -PRON- bolt a dinner
chapter_3	ignorance be the parent of fear and be completely nonplussed and confound about the stranger -PRON- confess -PRON- be now as much afraid of -PRON- as if -PRON- be the devil -PRON- who have thus break into -PRON- room at the dead of night
chapter_3	still more -PRON- very leg be mark as if a parcel of dark green frog be run up the trunk of young palm
chapter_3	-PRON- be now quite plain that -PRON- must be some abominable savage or other ship aboard of a whaleman in the south seas and so land in this christian country
chapter_3	-PRON- may take a fancy to mine heaven
chapter_3	look at that tomahawk
chapter_3	but there be no time for shudder for now the savage go about something that completely fascinate -PRON- attention and convince -PRON- that -PRON- must indeed be a heathen
chapter_3	go to -PRON- heavy grego or wrapall or dreadnaught which -PRON- have previously hang on a chair -PRON- fumble in the pocket and produce at length a curious little deform image with a hunch on -PRON- back and exactly the colour of a three day old congo baby
chapter_3	but see that -PRON- be not at all limber and that -PRON- glisten a good deal like polished ebony -PRON- conclude that -PRON- must be nothing but a wooden idol which indeed -PRON- prove to be
chapter_3	for now the savage go up to the empty fire place and remove the papered fire board set up this little hunch back image like a tenpin between the andiron
chapter_3	the chimney jamb and all the brick inside be very sooty so that -PRON- think this fire place make a very appropriate little shrine or chapel for -PRON- congo idol
chapter_3	-PRON- now screw -PRON- eye hard towards the half hide image feeling but ill at ease meantime to see what be next to follow
chapter_3	presently after many hasty snatch into the fire and still hasty withdrawal of -PRON- finger whereby -PRON- seem to be scorch -PRON- badly -PRON- at last succeed in draw out the biscuit then blow off the heat and ash a little -PRON- make a polite offer of -PRON- to the little negro
chapter_3	at last extinguish the fire -PRON- take the idol up very unceremoniously and bag -PRON- again in -PRON- grego pocket as carelessly as if -PRON- be a sportsman bag a dead woodcock
chapter_3	all these queer proceeding increase -PRON- uncomfortableness and see -PRON- now exhibit strong symptom of conclude -PRON- business operation and jump into bed with -PRON- -PRON- think -PRON- be high time now or never before the light be put out to break the spell in which -PRON- have so long be bind
chapter_3	but the interval -PRON- spend in deliberate what to say be a fatal one
chapter_3	take up -PRON- tomahawk from the table -PRON- examine the head of -PRON- for an instant and then hold -PRON- to the light with -PRON- mouth at the handle -PRON- puff out great cloud of tobacco smoke
chapter_3	-PRON- sing out -PRON- could not help -PRON- now and give a sudden grunt of astonishment -PRON- begin feel -PRON-
chapter_3	stammer out something -PRON- know not what -PRON- roll away from -PRON- against the wall and then conjure -PRON- whoever or whatev -PRON- may be to keep quiet and let -PRON- get up and light the lamp again
chapter_3	but -PRON- guttural response satisfy -PRON- at once that -PRON- but ill comprehend -PRON- meaning
chapter_3	who e debel -PRON-
chapter_3	and so say the light tomahawk begin flourish about -PRON- in the dark
chapter_3	landlord for god 's sake peter coffin shout i. landlord
chapter_3	coffin
chapter_3	angels save -PRON-
chapter_3	
chapter_3	dam -PRON- -PRON- kill e again growl the cannibal while -PRON- horrid flourishing of the tomahawk scatter the hot tobacco ash about -PRON- till -PRON- think -PRON- linen would get on fire
chapter_3	do not be afraid now say -PRON- grin again queequeg here would not harm a hair of -PRON- head
chapter_3	-PRON- think ye know'd
chapter_3	-PRON-
chapter_3	-PRON- sabbee
chapter_3	-PRON- this man sleepe -PRON- -PRON- sabbee

chapter_3	-PRON- sabbee plenty
chapter_3	-PRON- gettee in -PRON- add motion to -PRON- with -PRON- tomahawk and throw the clothe to one side
chapter_3	-PRON- really do this in not only a civil but a really kind and charitable way
chapter_3	-PRON- stand look at -PRON- a moment
chapter_3	better sleep with a sober cannibal than a drunken christian landlord say -PRON- tell -PRON- to stash -PRON- tomahawk there or pipe or whatev -PRON- call -PRON- tell -PRON- to stop smoke in short and -PRON- will turn in with -PRON-
chapter_3	-PRON- be dangerous
chapter_3	besides -PRON- be not insure
chapter_3	this be tell to queequeg -PRON- at once comply and again politely motion -PRON- to get into bed roll over to one side as much as to say -PRON- will not touch a leg of ye
chapter_3	good night landlord say -PRON- -PRON- may go
chapter_3	
chapter_3	-PRON- turn in and never sleep better in -PRON- life
chapter_4	upon wake next morning about daylight -PRON- find queequeg 's arm throw over -PRON- in the most loving and affectionate manner
chapter_4	-PRON- sensation be strange
chapter_4	let -PRON- try to explain -PRON-
chapter_4	the circumstance be this
chapter_4	-PRON- have be cut up some caper or other -PRON- think -PRON- be try to crawl up the chimney as -PRON- have see a little sweep do a few day previous and -PRON- stepmother who somehow or other be all the time whip -PRON- or send -PRON- to bed supperless -PRON- mother drag -PRON- by the leg out of the chimney and pack -PRON- off to bed though -PRON- be only two o'clock in the afternoon of the 21st june the long day in the year in -PRON- hemisphere
chapter_4	but there be no help for -PRON- so up stair -PRON- go to -PRON- little room in the third floor undress -PRON- as slowly as possible so as to kill time and with a bitter sigh get between the sheet
chapter_4	-PRON- lay there dismally calculate that sixteen entire hour must elapse before -PRON- could hope for a resurrection
chapter_4	sixteen hour in bed
chapter_4	-PRON- feel bad and bad at last -PRON- get up dress and softly go down in -PRON- stockinged foot seek out -PRON- stepmother and suddenly throw -PRON- at -PRON- foot beseech -PRON- as a particular favour to give -PRON- a good slippering for -PRON- misbehaviour
chapter_4	anything indeed but condemn -PRON- to lie abed such an unendurable length of time
chapter_4	but -PRON- be the good and most conscientious of stepmother and back -PRON- have to go to -PRON- room
chapter_4	for what seem age pile on age -PRON- lay there freeze with the most awful fear not dare to drag away -PRON- hand yet ever think that if -PRON- could but stir -PRON- one single inch the horrid spell would be broken
chapter_4	-PRON- know not how this consciousness at last glide away from -PRON- but wake in the morning -PRON- shudderingly remember -PRON- all and for day and week and month afterwards -PRON- lose -PRON- in confound attempt to explain the mystery
chapter_4	nay to this very hour -PRON- often puzzle -PRON- with -PRON-
chapter_4	but at length all the past night 's event soberly recur one by one in fix reality and then -PRON- lay only alive to the comical predicament
chapter_4	for though -PRON- try to move -PRON- arm unlock -PRON- bridegroom clasp yet sleep as -PRON- be -PRON- still hug -PRON- tightly as though naught but death should part -PRON- twain
chapter_4	"-PRON- now strove to rouse him--""queequeg!""--but -PRON- only answer be a snore"
chapter_4	-PRON- then roll over -PRON- neck feeling as if -PRON- be in a horse collar and suddenly feel a slight scratch
chapter_4	throw aside the counterpane there lie the tomahawk sleeping by the savage 's side as if -PRON- be a hatchet faced baby
chapter_4	a pretty pickle truly think -PRON- abed here in a strange house in the broad day with a cannibal and a tomahawk
chapter_4	
chapter_4	at length by dint of much wriggling and loud and incessant expostulation upon the unbecomingness of -PRON- hug a fellow male in that matrimonial sort of style -PRON- succeed in extract a grunt and presently -PRON- draw back -PRON- arm shake -PRON- all over like a newfoundland dog just from the water and sit up in bed stiff as a pike staff look at -PRON- and rub -PRON- eye as if -PRON- do not altogether remember how -PRON- come to be there though a dim consciousness of know something about -PRON- seem slowly dawn over -PRON-
chapter_4	when at last -PRON- mind seem make up touch the character of -PRON- bedfellow and -PRON- become as -PRON- be reconcile to the fact -PRON- jump out upon the floor and by certain sign and sound give -PRON- to understand that if -PRON- please -PRON- -PRON- would dress first and then leave -PRON- to dress afterwards leave the whole apartment to -PRON-
chapter_4	think -PRON- queequeg under the circumstance this be a very civilized overture but the truth be these savage have an innate sense of delicacy say what -PRON- will -PRON- be marvellous how essentially polite -PRON- be
chapter_4	-PRON- pay this particular compliment to queequeg because -PRON- treat -PRON- with so much civility and consideration while -PRON- be guilty of great rudeness star at -PRON- from the bed and watch all -PRON- toilette motion for the time -PRON- curiosity get the good of -PRON- breeding
chapter_4	nevertheless a man like queequeg -PRON- do not see every day -PRON- and -PRON- way be well worth unusual regarding
chapter_4	what under the heaven -PRON- do -PRON- for -PRON- can not tell but -PRON- next movement be to crush -PRON- boot in hand and hat on under the bed when from sundry violent gasping and straining -PRON- infer -PRON- be hard at work boot -PRON- though by no law of propriety that -PRON- ever hear of be any man require to be private when put on -PRON- boot
chapter_4	but queequeg do -PRON- see be a creature in the transition stage neither caterpillar nor butterfly
chapter_4	-PRON- be just enough civilized to show off -PRON- outlandishness in the strange possible manner
chapter_4	-PRON- education be not yet complete
chapter_4	-PRON- be an undergraduate
chapter_4	see now that there be no curtain to the window and that the street be very narrow the house opposite command a plain view into the room and observe more and more the indecorous figure that queequeg make stave about with little else but -PRON- hat and boot on -PRON- beg -PRON- as well as -PRON- could to accelerate -PRON- toilet somewhat and particularly to get into -PRON- pantaloon as soon as possible
chapter_4	-PRON- comply and then proceed to wash -PRON-
chapter_4	at that time in the morning any christian would have wash -PRON- face but queequeg to -PRON- amazement content -PRON- with restrict -PRON- ablution to -PRON- chest arm and hand
chapter_4	-PRON- then don -PRON- waistcoat and take up a piece of hard soap on the wash stand centre table dip -PRON- into water and commence lather -PRON- face
chapter_4	think -PRON- queequeg this be use rogers 's good cutlery with a vengeance
chapter_4	afterwards -PRON- wonder the less at this operation when -PRON- come to know of what fine steel the head of a harpoon be make and how exceedingly sharp the long straight edge be always keep
chapter_4	the rest of -PRON- toilet be soon achieve and -PRON- proudly march out of the room wrap up in -PRON- great pilot monkey jacket and sport -PRON- harpoon like a marshal 's baton
chapter_5	-PRON- quickly follow suit and descend into the bar room accost the grin landlord very pleasantly
chapter_5	-PRON- cherish no malice towards -PRON- though -PRON- have be skylark with -PRON- not a little in the matter of -PRON- bedfellow
chapter_5	and the man that have anything bountifully laughable about -PRON- be sure there be more in that man than -PRON- perhaps think for
chapter_5	the bar room be now full of the boarder who have be drop in the night previous and whom -PRON- have not as yet have a good look at
chapter_5	this young fellow 's healthy cheek be like a sun toast pear in hue and would seem to smell almost as musky -PRON- can not have be three day land from -PRON- indian voyage
chapter_5	that man next -PRON- look a few shade light -PRON- may say a touch of satin wood be in -PRON-
chapter_5	in the complexion of a third still linger a tropic tawn but slightly bleached withal he doubtless have tarry whole week ashore
chapter_5	grub ho
chapter_5	now cry the landlord fling open a door and in -PRON- go to breakfast
chapter_5	-PRON- say that man who have see the world thereby become quite at ease in manner quite self possess in company
chapter_5	not always though ledyard the great new england traveller and mungo park the scotch one of all man -PRON- possess the least assurance in the parlor
chapter_5	but perhaps the mere crossing of siberia in a sledge draw by dog as ledyard do or the take a long solitary walk on an empty stomach in the negro heart of africa which be the sum of poor mungo 's performance this kind of travel -PRON- say
chapter_5	may not be the very good mode of attain a high social polish
chapter_5	still for the most part that sort of thing be to be have anywhere
chapter_5	that after -PRON- be all seat at the table and -PRON- be prepare to hear some good story about whale to -PRON- no small surprise nearly every man maintain a profound silence
chapter_5	yes here be a set of sea dog many of whom without the slight bashfulness have board great whale on the high sea entire stranger to -PRON- and duel -PRON- dead without winking and yet here -PRON- sit at a social breakfast table all of the same calling all of kindred taste look round as sheepishly at each other as though -PRON- have never be out of sight of some sheepfold among the green mountains
chapter_5	a curious sight these bashful bear these timid warrior whaleman
chapter_5	but as for queequeg why queequeg sit there among -PRON- at the head of the table too -PRON- so chance as cool as an icicle
chapter_5	to be sure -PRON- can not say much for -PRON- breeding
chapter_5	but that be certainly very coolly do by -PRON- and every one know that in most people 's estimation to do anything coolly be to do -PRON- genteelly
chapter_5	enough that when breakfast be over -PRON- withdraw like the rest into the public room light -PRON- tomahawk pipe and be sit there quietly digest and smoking with -PRON- inseparable hat on when -PRON- sally out for a stroll
chapter_6	the street
chapter_6	if -PRON- have be astonish at first catch a glimpse of so outlandish an individual as queequeg circulate among the polite society of a civilized town that astonishment soon depart upon take -PRON- first daylight stroll through the street of new bedford
chapter_6	in thoroughfare nigh the dock any considerable seaport will frequently offer to view the queer looking nondescript from foreign part
chapter_6	but new bedford beat all water street and wapping
chapter_6	in these last mention haunt -PRON- see only sailor but in new bedford actual cannibal stand chat at street corner savage outright many of whom yet carry on -PRON- bone unholy flesh
chapter_6	but besides the feegeeans tongatobooarrs erromanggoans pannangians and brighggians and besides the wild specimen of the whaling craft which unheed reel about the street -PRON- will see other sight still more curious certainly more comical
chapter_6	there weekly arrive in this town score of green vermonters and new hampshire man all athirst for gain and glory in the fishery
chapter_6	in some thing -PRON- would think -PRON- but a few hour old
chapter_6	look there
chapter_6	-PRON- wear a beaver hat and swallow tail coat girdle with a sailor belt and sheath knife
chapter_6	here come another with a sou'-wester and a bombazine cloak
chapter_6	no town breed dandy will compare with a country breed one -PRON- mean a downright bumpkin dandy a fellow that in the dog day will mow -PRON- two acre in buckskin glove for fear of tan -PRON- hand
chapter_6	in bespeak -PRON- sea outfit -PRON- order bell button to -PRON- waistcoat strap to -PRON- canvas trowser
chapter_6	ah poor hay seed how bitterly will burst those strap in the first howl gale when thou art drive strap button and all down the throat of the tempest
chapter_6	but think not that this famous town have only harpooneer cannibal and bumpkin to show -PRON- visitor
chapter_6	not at all
chapter_6	still new bedford be a queer place
chapter_6	as -PRON- be part of -PRON- back country be enough to frighten one -PRON- look so bony
chapter_6	the town -PRON- be perhaps the dear place to live in in all new england
chapter_6	the street do not run with milk nor in the spring time do -PRON- pave -PRON- with fresh egg
chapter_6	yet in spite of this nowhere in all america will -PRON- find more patrician like house park and garden more opulent than in new bedford
chapter_6	whence come -PRON-
chapter_6	how plant upon this once scraggy scoria of a country
chapter_6	go and gaze upon the iron emblematical harpoon round yonder lofty mansion and -PRON- question will be answer
chapter_6	yes all these brave house and flowery garden come from the atlantic pacific and indian ocean
chapter_6	one and all -PRON- be harpoon and drag up hither from the bottom of the sea
chapter_6	in new bedford father -PRON- say give whale for dower to -PRON- daughter and portion off -PRON- niece with a few porpoise a piece
chapter_6	in summer time the town be sweet to see full of fine maple long avenue of green and gold
chapter_6	and in august high in air the beautiful and bountiful horse chestnut candelabra wise proffer the passer by -PRON- taper upright cone of congregate blossom
chapter_6	so omnipotent be art which in many a district of new bedford have superinduc bright terrace of flower upon the barren refuse rock throw aside at creation 's final day
chapter_6	and the woman of new bedford -PRON- bloom like -PRON- own red rose
chapter_6	but rose only bloom in summer whereas the fine carnation of -PRON- cheek be perennial as sunlight in the seventh heaven
chapter_6	elsewhere match that bloom of -PRON- ye can not save in salem where -PRON- tell -PRON- the young girl breathe such musk -PRON- sailor sweetheart smell -PRON- mile off shore as though -PRON- be draw nigh the odorous moluccas instead of the puritanic sand
chapter_7	the chapel
chapter_7	in this same new bedford there stand a whaleman 's chapel and few be the moody fisherman shortly bind for the indian ocean or pacific who fail to make a sunday visit to the spot
chapter_7	-PRON- be sure that -PRON- do not
chapter_7	the sky have change from clear sunny cold to drive sleet and mist
chapter_7	wrap -PRON- in -PRON- shaggy jacket of the cloth call bearskin -PRON- fight -PRON- way against the stubborn storm
chapter_7	entering -PRON- find a small scatter congregation of sailor and sailor wife and widow
chapter_7	a muffled silence reign only break at time by the shriek of the storm
chapter_7	each silent worshipper seem purposely sit apart from the other as if each silent grief be insular and incommunicable
chapter_7	the chaplain have not yet arrive and there these silent island of man and woman sit steadfastly eye several marble tablet with black border mason into the wall on either side the pulpit

chapter_7	shake off the sleet from -PRON- ice glazed hat and jacket -PRON- seat -PRON- near the door and turn sideways be surprised to see queequeg near -PRON-
chapter_7	affect by the solemnity of the scene there be a wonder gaze of incredulous curiosity in -PRON- countenance
chapter_7	this savage be the only person present who seem to notice -PRON- entrance because -PRON- be the only one who could not read and therefore be not read those frigid inscription on the wall
chapter_7	oh
chapter_7	ye whose dead lie bury beneath the green grass who stand among flower can say here here lie -PRON- beloved ye know not the desolation that brood in bosom like these
chapter_7	what bitter blank in those black border marble which cover no ash
chapter_7	as well may those tablet stand in the cave of elephanta as here
chapter_7	in what census of live creature the dead of mankind be include why -PRON- be that a universal proverb say of -PRON- that -PRON- tell no tale though contain more secret than the goodwin sands how -PRON- be that to -PRON- name who yesterday depart for the other world -PRON- prefix so significant and infidel a word and yet do not thus entitle -PRON- if -PRON- but embark for the remote indies of this live earth why the life insurance companies pay death forfeiture upon immortal in what eternal unstirr paralysis and deadly hopeless trance yet lie antique adam who die sixty round century ago how -PRON- be that -PRON- still refuse to be comfort for those who -PRON- nevertheless maintain be dwell in unspeakable bliss why all the live so strive to hush all the dead wherefore but the rumor of a knock in a tomb will terrify a whole city
chapter_7	all these thing be not without -PRON- meaning
chapter_7	but faith like a jackal feed among the tomb and even from these dead doubt -PRON- gather -PRON- most vital hope
chapter_7	-PRON- need scarcely to be tell with what feeling on the eve of a nantucket voyage -PRON- regard those marble tablet and by the murky light of that darken doleful day read the fate of the whaleman who have go before -PRON-
chapter_7	yes ishmael the same fate may be thine
chapter_7	but somehow -PRON- grow merry again
chapter_7	delightful inducement to embark fine chance for promotion -PRON- seem aye a stove boat will make -PRON- an immortal by brevet
chapter_7	yes there be death in this business of whaling a speechlessly quick chaotic bundling of a man into eternity
chapter_7	but what then
chapter_7	methinks -PRON- have hugely mistake this matter of life and death
chapter_7	methinks that what -PRON- call -PRON- shadow here on earth be -PRON- true substance
chapter_7	methinks -PRON- body be but the lee of -PRON- good being
chapter_7	in fact take -PRON- body who will take -PRON- -PRON- say -PRON- be not -PRON-
chapter_7	and therefore three cheer for nantucket and come a stove boat and stove body when -PRON- will for stave -PRON- soul jove -PRON- can not
chapter_8	the pulpit
chapter_8	a man of a certain venerable robustness enter immediately as the storm pelt door fly back upon admit -PRON- a quick regardful eyeing of -PRON- by all the congregation sufficiently attested that this fine old man be the chaplain
chapter_8	-PRON- have be a sailor and a harpooneer in -PRON- youth but for many year past have dedicate -PRON- life to the ministry
chapter_8	at the time -PRON- now write of father mapple be in the hardy winter of a healthy old age that sort of old age which seem merge into a second flower youth for among all the fissure of -PRON- wrinkle there shine certain mild gleams of a newly develop bloom the spring verdure peep forth even beneath february 's snow
chapter_8	no one have previously hear -PRON- history could for the first time behold father mapple without the utmost interest because there be certain engrafted clerical peculiarity about -PRON- imputable to that adventurous maritime life -PRON- have lead
chapter_8	when -PRON- enter -PRON- observe that -PRON- carry no umbrella and certainly have not come in -PRON- carriage for -PRON- tarpaulin hat run down with melt sleet and -PRON- great pilot cloth jacket seem almost to drag -PRON- to the floor with the weight of the water -PRON- have absorb
chapter_8	however hat and coat and overshoe be one by one remove and hang up in a little space in an adjacent corner when array in a decent suit -PRON- quietly approach the pulpit
chapter_8	like most old fashioned pulpit -PRON- be a very lofty one and since a regular stair to such a height would by -PRON- long angle with the floor seriously contract the already small area of the chapel the architect -PRON- seem have act upon the hint of father mapple and finish the pulpit without a stair substitute a perpendicular side ladder like those use in mount a ship from a boat at sea
chapter_8	halt for an instant at the foot of the ladder and with both hand grasp the ornamental knob of the man rope father mapple cast a look upwards and then with a truly sailor like but still reverential dexterity hand over hand mount the step as if ascend the main top of -PRON- vessel
chapter_8	the perpendicular part of this side ladder as be usually the case with swing one be of cloth cover rope only the round be of wood so that at every step there be a joint
chapter_8	at -PRON- first glimpse of the pulpit -PRON- have not escape -PRON- that however convenient for a ship these joint in the present instance seem unnecessary
chapter_8	for -PRON- be not prepared to see father mapple after gain the height slowly turn round and stoop over the pulpit deliberately drag up the ladder step by step till the whole be deposit within leave -PRON- impregnable in -PRON- little quebec
chapter_8	-PRON- ponder some time without fully comprehend the reason for this
chapter_8	father mapple enjoy such a wide reputation for sincerity and sanctity that -PRON- could not suspect -PRON- of court notoriety by any mere trick of the stage
chapter_8	-PRON- there must be some sober reason for this thing furthermore -PRON- must symbolize something unseen
chapter_8	can -PRON- be then that by that act of physical isolation -PRON- signify -PRON- spiritual withdrawal for the time from all outward worldly tie and connexion
chapter_8	between the marble cenotaph on either hand of the pulpit the wall which form -PRON- back be adorn with a large painting represent a gallant ship beat against a terrible storm off a lee coast of black rock and snowy breaker
chapter_8	but high above the fly scud and dark roll cloud there float a little isle of sunlight from which beam forth an angel 's face and this bright face shed a distinct spot of radiance upon the ship 's toss deck something like that silver plate now insert into the victory 's plank where nelson fall
chapter_8	ah noble ship the angel seem to say beat on beat on thou noble ship and bear a hardy helm for lo
chapter_8	the sun be break through the cloud be roll off serene azure be at hand
chapter_8	nor be the pulpit -PRON- without a trace of the same sea taste that have achieve the ladder and the picture
chapter_8	-PRON- panelled front be in the likeness of a ship 's bluff bow and the holy bible rest on a project piece of scroll work fashion after a ship 's fiddle head beak
chapter_8	from thence -PRON- be the storm of god 's quick wrath be first descry and the bow must bear the early brunt
chapter_8	yes the world be a ship on -PRON- passage out and not a voyage complete and the pulpit be -PRON- prow
chapter_9	the sermon father mapple rise and in a mild voice of unassuming authority order the scatter people to condense
chapter_9	there be a low rumbling of heavy sea boot among the bench and a still slight shuffling of woman 's shoe and all be quiet again and every eye on the preacher
chapter_9	this end in prolong solemn tone like the continual tolling of a bell in a ship that be founder at sea in a fog in such tone -PRON- commence read the follow hymn but change -PRON- manner towards the conclude stanzas burst forth with a peal exultation and joy-- the rib and terror in the whale arched over -PRON- a dismal gloom while all god 's sun light wave roll by and lift -PRON- deepen down to doom
chapter_9	oh -PRON- be plunge to despair
chapter_9	in black distress -PRON- call -PRON- god when -PRON- could scarce believe -PRON- mine -PRON- bow -PRON- ear to -PRON- complaints-- no more the whale do -PRON- confine
chapter_9	with speed -PRON- fly to -PRON- relief as on a radiant dolphin borne awful yet bright as lightning shine the face of -PRON- deliverer god
chapter_9	nearly all join in sing this hymn which swell high above the howling of the storm
chapter_9	a brief pause ensue the preacher slowly turn over the leaf of the bible and at last fold -PRON- hand down upon the proper page say beloved shipmate clinch the last verse of the first chapter of jonah--'and god have prepare a great fish to swallow up jonah
chapter_9	yet what depth of the soul do jonah 's deep sealine sound
chapter_9	what a pregnant lesson to -PRON- be this prophet
chapter_9	but what be this lesson that the book of jonah teach
chapter_9	as sinful man -PRON- be a lesson to -PRON- all because -PRON- be a story of the sin hard heartedness suddenly awaken fear the swift punishment repentance prayer and finally the deliverance and joy of jonah
chapter_9	as with all sinner among man the sin of this son of amittai be in -PRON- wilful disobedience of the command of god never mind now what that command be or how convey which -PRON- find a hard command
chapter_9	but all the thing that god would have -PRON- do are hard for -PRON- to do remember that and hence -PRON- oftener command -PRON- than endeavor to persuade
chapter_9	-PRON- think that a ship make by man will carry -PRON- into country where god do not reign but only the captains of this earth
chapter_9	-PRON- skulk about the wharf of joppa and seek a ship that be bind for tarshish
chapter_9	there lurk perhaps a hitherto unheeded meaning here
chapter_9	that be the opinion of learn man
chapter_9	because joppa the modern jaffa shipmate be on the most easterly coast of the mediterranean the syrian and tarshish or cadiz more than two thousand mile to the westward from that just outside the straits of gibraltar
chapter_9	see ye not then shipmate that jonah seek to flee world wide from god
chapter_9	miserable man
chapter_9	oh most contemptible and worthy of all scorn with slouched hat and guilty eye skulk from -PRON- god prowl among the shipping like a vile burglar hasten to cross the sea
chapter_9	how plainly -PRON- be a fugitive
chapter_9	no friend accompany -PRON- to the wharf with -PRON- adieux
chapter_9	at last after much dodging search -PRON- find the tarshish ship receive the last item of -PRON- cargo and as -PRON- step on board to see -PRON- captain in the cabin all the sailor for the moment desist from hoist in the good to mark the stranger 's evil eye
chapter_9	jonah see this but in vain -PRON- try to look all ease and confidence in vain essay -PRON- wretched smile
chapter_9	strong intuition of the man assure the mariner -PRON- can be no innocent
chapter_9	"in -PRON- gamesome but still serious way one whisper to the other--""jack -PRON- be rob a widow or joe do -PRON- mark -PRON- -PRON- be a bigamist or harry lad -PRON- guess -PRON- be the adulterer that break jail in old gomorrah or belike one of the miss murderer from sodom"
chapter_9	another run to read the bill that be stick against the spile upon the wharf to which the ship be moor offer five hundred gold coin for the apprehension of a parricide and contain a description of -PRON- person
chapter_9	-PRON- read and look from jonah to the bill while all -PRON- sympathetic shipmate now crowd round jonah prepare to lay -PRON- hand upon -PRON-
chapter_9	frighted jonah tremble and summon all -PRON- boldness to -PRON- face only look so much the more a coward
chapter_9	so -PRON- make the good of -PRON- and when the sailor find -PRON- not to be the man that be advertise -PRON- let -PRON- pass and -PRON- descend into the cabin
chapter_9	cry the captain at -PRON- busy desk hurriedly make out -PRON- paper for the customs--'who 's there
chapter_9	oh how that harmless question mangle jonah
chapter_9	but -PRON- rally
chapter_9	-PRON- seek a passage in this ship to tarshish how soon sail ye sir

chapter_9	no sooner sir?'--'soon enough for any honest man that go a passenger
chapter_9	jonah that be another stab
chapter_9	but -PRON- swiftly call away the captain from that scent
chapter_9	how much be that
chapter_9	i'll pay now
chapter_9	for -PRON- be particularly write shipmate as if -PRON- be a thing not to be overlook in this history that -PRON- pay the fare thereof ere the craft do sail
chapter_9	and take with the context this be full of meaning
chapter_9	now jonah 's captain shipmate be one whose discernment detect crime in any but whose cupidity expose -PRON- only in the penniless
chapter_9	then the captain know that jonah be a fugitive but at the same time resolve to help a flight that pave -PRON- rear with gold
chapter_9	yet when jonah fairly take out -PRON- purse prudent suspicion still molest the captain
chapter_9	-PRON- ring every coin to find a counterfeit
chapter_9	not a forger any way -PRON- mutter and jonah be put down for -PRON- passage
chapter_9	point out -PRON- state room sir say jonah now -PRON- be travel weary -PRON- need sleep
chapter_9	jonah enter and would lock the door but the lock contain no key
chapter_9	hear -PRON- foolishly fumble there the captain laugh lowly to -PRON- and mutter something about the door of convict cell be never allow to be lock within
chapter_9	all dressed and dusty as -PRON- be jonah throw -PRON- into -PRON- berth and find the little state room ceiling almost rest on -PRON- forehead
chapter_9	the air be close and jonah gasp
chapter_9	then in that contract hole sink too beneath the ship 's water line jonah feel the herald presentiment of that stifle hour when the whale shall hold -PRON- in the small of -PRON- bowel ward
chapter_9	screwed at -PRON- axis against the side a swinging lamp slightly oscillate in jonah 's room and the ship heel over towards the wharf with the weight of the last bale receive the lamp flame and all though in slight motion still maintain a permanent obliquity with reference to the room though in truth infallibly straight -PRON- -PRON- but make obvious the false lie level among which -PRON- hang
chapter_9	the lamp alarm and frighten jonah as lie in -PRON- berth -PRON- tormented eye roll round the place and this thus far successful fugitive find no refuge for -PRON- restless glance
chapter_9	but that contradiction in the lamp more and more appal -PRON-
chapter_9	
chapter_9	so -PRON- conscience hang in -PRON-
chapter_9	so after sore wrestling in -PRON- berth jonah 's prodigy of ponderous misery drag -PRON- drown down to sleep
chapter_9	that ship -PRON- friend be the first of record smuggler
chapter_9	but the sea rebel -PRON- will not bear the wicked burden
chapter_9	but now when the boatswain call all hand to lighten -PRON- when box bale and jar be clatter overboard when the wind be shriek and the man be yell and every plank thunder with trample foot right over jonah 's head in all this rag tumult jonah sleep -PRON- hideous sleep
chapter_9	-PRON- see no black sky and rag sea feel not the reel timber and little hear -PRON- or heed -PRON- the far rush of the mighty whale which even now with open mouth be cleave the sea after -PRON-
chapter_9	but the frightened master come to -PRON- and shriek in -PRON- dead ear what mean thou o sleeper arise
chapter_9	terror upon terror run shout through -PRON- soul
chapter_9	in all -PRON- cringe attitude the god fugitive be now too plainly know
chapter_9	the lot be jonah 's that discover then how furiously -PRON- mob -PRON- with -PRON- question
chapter_9	what be thine occupation
chapter_9	whence comest thou
chapter_9	thy country
chapter_9	what people
chapter_9	but mark now -PRON- shipmate the behavior of poor jonah
chapter_9	the eager mariner but ask -PRON- who -PRON- be and where from whereas -PRON- not only receive an answer to those question but likewise another answer to a question not put by -PRON- but the unsolicited answer be force from jonah by the hard hand of god that be upon -PRON-
chapter_9	fear -PRON- o jonah
chapter_9	aye well mightest thou fear the lord god then
chapter_9	straightway -PRON- now go on to make a full confession whereupon the mariner become more and more appalled but still be pitiful
chapter_9	for when jonah not yet supplicate god for mercy since -PRON- but too well know the darkness of -PRON- desert when wretched jonah cry out to -PRON- to take -PRON- and cast -PRON- forth into the sea for -PRON- know that for his sake this great tempest be upon -PRON- -PRON- mercifully turn from -PRON- and seek by other mean to save the ship
chapter_9	but all in vain the indignant gale howl louder then with one hand raise invokingly to god with the other -PRON- not unreluctantly lie hold of jonah
chapter_9	and now behold jonah take up as an anchor and drop into the sea when instantly an oily calmness float out from the east and the sea be still as jonah carry down the gale with -PRON- leave smooth water behind
chapter_9	then jonah pray unto the lord out of the fish 's belly
chapter_9	but observe -PRON- prayer and learn a weighty lesson
chapter_9	for sinful as -PRON- be jonah do not weep and wail for direct deliverance
chapter_9	-PRON- feel that -PRON- dreadful punishment be just
chapter_9	-PRON- leave all -PRON- deliverance to god content -PRON- with this that spite of all -PRON- pain and pang -PRON- will still look towards -PRON- holy temple
chapter_9	and here shipmate be true and faithful repentance not clamorous for pardon but grateful for punishment
chapter_9	and how pleasing to god be this conduct in jonah be show in the eventual deliverance of -PRON- from the sea and the whale
chapter_9	but -PRON- do place -PRON- before -PRON- as a model for repentance
chapter_9	sin not but if -PRON- do take heed to repent of -PRON- like jonah
chapter_9	while -PRON- be speak these word the howling of the shrieking slant storm without seem to add new power to the preacher who when describe jonah 's sea storm seem toss by a storm -PRON-
chapter_9	there now come a lull in -PRON- look as -PRON- silently turn over the leaf of the book once more and at last stand motionless with closed eye for the moment seem commune with god and -PRON-
chapter_9	but again -PRON- lean over towards the people and bow -PRON- head lowly with an aspect of the deep yet manly humility -PRON- spake these word shipmates god have lay but one hand upon -PRON- both -PRON- hand press upon -PRON-
chapter_9	-PRON- have read ye by what murky light may be -PRON- the lesson that jonah teach to all sinner and therefore to ye and still more to -PRON- for -PRON- be a great sinner than ye
chapter_9	as -PRON- have see god come upon -PRON- in the whale and swallow -PRON- down to live gulfs of doom and with swift slanting tear -PRON- along into the midst of the sea where the eddy depth suck -PRON- ten thousand fathom down and the weed be wrap about -PRON- head and all the watery world of woe bowl over -PRON-
chapter_9	the whale ground upon the ocean 's utmost bone even then god hear the engulphed repent prophet when -PRON- cry
chapter_9	then god spake unto the fish and from the shudder cold and blackness of the sea the whale come breech up towards the warm and pleasant sun and all the delight of air and earth and vomit out jonah upon the dry land when the word of the lord come a second time and jonah bruise and beat -PRON- ear like two sea shell still multitudinously murmur of the ocean jonah do the almighty 's bidding
chapter_9	and what be that shipmate
chapter_9	to preach the truth to the face of falsehood
chapter_9	woe to -PRON- whom this world charm from gospel duty
chapter_9	woe to -PRON- who seek to pour oil upon the water when god have brew -PRON- into a gale
chapter_9	woe to -PRON- who seek to please rather than to appal
chapter_9	woe to -PRON- whose good name be more to -PRON- than goodness
chapter_9	woe to -PRON- who would not be true even though to be false be salvation
chapter_9	yea woe to -PRON- who as the great pilot paul have -PRON- while preach to other be -PRON- a castaway
chapter_9	be not the main truck high than the kelson be low
chapter_9	delight be to -PRON- a far far upward and inward delight who against the proud god and commodore of this earth ever stand forth -PRON- own inexorable self
chapter_9	delight be to -PRON- whose strong arm yet support -PRON- when the ship of this base treacherous world have go down beneath -PRON-
chapter_9	delight be to -PRON- who give no quarter in the truth and kill burn and destroy all sin though -PRON- pluck -PRON- out from under the robe of senators and judges
chapter_9	delight be to -PRON- whom all the wave of the billow of the sea of the boisterous mob can never shake from this sure keel of the ages
chapter_9	and eternal delight and deliciousness will be -PRON- who come to lay -PRON- down can say with -PRON- final breath o father!--chiefly know to -PRON- by thy rod mortal or immortal here -PRON- die
chapter_9	-PRON- have strive to be thine more than to be this world 's or -PRON- own
chapter_9	yet this be nothing -PRON- leave eternity to thee for what be man that -PRON- should live out the lifetime of -PRON- god
chapter_9	-PRON- say no more but slowly wave a benediction cover -PRON- face with -PRON- hand and so remain kneel till all the people have depart and -PRON- be leave alone in the place
chapter_10	return to the spouter inn from the chapel -PRON- find queequeg there quite alone -PRON- have leave the chapel before the benediction some time
chapter_10	-PRON- would then begin again at the next fifty seem to commence at number one each time as though -PRON- could not count more than fifty and -PRON- be only by such a large number of fifty be find together that -PRON- astonishment at the multitude of page be excited
chapter_10	through all -PRON- unearthly tattooing -PRON- think -PRON- see the trace of a simple honest heart and in -PRON- large deep eye fiery black and bold there seem token of a spirit that would dare a thousand devil
chapter_10	and besides all this there be a certain lofty bearing about the pagan which even -PRON- uncouthness could not altogether maim
chapter_10	-PRON- look like a man who have never cringe and never have have a creditor
chapter_10	whether -PRON- be too that -PRON- head be shave -PRON- forehead be draw out in free and bright relief and look more expansive than -PRON- otherwise would this -PRON- will not venture to decide but certain -PRON- be -PRON- head be phrenologically an excellent one
chapter_10	-PRON- may seem ridiculous but -PRON- remind -PRON- of general washington 's head as see in the popular bust of -PRON-
chapter_10	queequeg be george washington cannibalistically develop
chapter_10	consider how sociably -PRON- have be sleep together the night previous and especially consider the affectionate arm -PRON- have find throw over -PRON- upon wake in the morning -PRON- think this indifference of -PRON- very strange
chapter_10	but savage be strange being at time -PRON- do not know exactly how to take -PRON-
chapter_10	-PRON- have notice also that queequeg never consort at all or but very little with the other seaman in the inn
chapter_10	-PRON- make no advance whatev appear to have no desire to enlarge the circle of -PRON- acquaintance
chapter_10	but perhaps to be true philosopher -PRON- mortal should not be conscious of so live or so strive
chapter_10	so soon as -PRON- hear that such or such a man give -PRON- out for a philosopher -PRON- conclude that like the dyspeptic old woman -PRON- must have break -PRON- digester
chapter_10	as -PRON- sit there in that now lonely room the fire burn low in that mild stage when after -PRON- first intensity have warm the air -PRON- then only glow to be look at the evening shade and phantom gather round the casement and peer in upon -PRON- silent solitary twain the storm boom without in solemn swell -PRON- begin to be sensible of strange feeling
chapter_10	-PRON- feel a melting in -PRON-
chapter_10	no more -PRON- splintered heart and maddened hand be turn against the wolfish world
chapter_10	this soothe savage have redeem -PRON-
chapter_10	there -PRON- sit -PRON- very indifference speak a nature in which there lurk no civilized hypocrisy and bland deceit
chapter_10	wild -PRON- be a very sight of sight to see yet -PRON- begin to feel -PRON- mysteriously draw towards -PRON-
chapter_10	and those same thing that would have repel most other -PRON- be the very magnet that thus draw -PRON-
chapter_10	-PRON- since christian kindness have prove but hollow courtesy
chapter_10	-PRON- draw -PRON- bench near -PRON- and make some friendly sign and hint do -PRON- best to talk with -PRON- meanwhile
chapter_10	at first -PRON- little notice these advance but presently upon -PRON- referring to -PRON- last night 's hospitality -PRON- make out to ask -PRON- whether -PRON- be again to be bedfellow
chapter_10	-PRON- tell -PRON- yes whereat -PRON- think -PRON- look pleased perhaps a little compliment
chapter_10	-PRON- then turn over the book together and -PRON- endeavor to explain to -PRON- the purpose of the printing and the meaning of the few picture that be in -PRON-
chapter_10	thus -PRON- soon engage -PRON- interest and from that -PRON- go to jabber the good -PRON- could about the various outer sight to be see in this famous town
chapter_10	soon -PRON- propose a social smoke and produce -PRON- pouch and tomahawk -PRON- quietly offer -PRON- a puff
chapter_10	and then -PRON- sit exchange puff from that wild pipe of -PRON- and keep -PRON- regularly pass between -PRON-
chapter_10	if there yet lurk any ice of indifference towards -PRON- in the pagan 's breast this pleasant genial smoke -PRON- have soon thaw -PRON- out and leave -PRON- crony
chapter_10	after supper and another social chat and smoke -PRON- go to -PRON- room together
chapter_10	-PRON- make -PRON- a present of -PRON- embalm head take out -PRON- enormous tobacco wallet and grope under the tobacco draw out some thirty dollar in silver then spread -PRON- on the table and mechanically divide -PRON- into two equal portion push one of -PRON- towards -PRON- and say -PRON- be -PRON-
chapter_10	-PRON- be go to remonstrate but -PRON- silence -PRON- by pour -PRON- into -PRON- trowser pocket
chapter_10	-PRON- let -PRON- stay
chapter_10	-PRON- then go about -PRON- evening prayer take out -PRON- idol and remove the paper fireboard
chapter_10	how then could -PRON- unite with this wild idolator in worship -PRON- piece of wood
chapter_10	but what be worship think i. do -PRON- suppose now ishmael that the magnanimous god of heaven and earth pagan and all include can possibly be jealous of an insignificant bit of black wood
chapter_10	impossible
chapter_10	now queequeg be -PRON- fellow man
chapter_10	and what do -PRON- wish that this queequeg would do to -PRON-
chapter_10	consequently -PRON- must then unite with -PRON- in -PRON- ergo -PRON- must turn idolator
chapter_10	so -PRON- kindle the shaving help prop up the innocent little idol offer -PRON- burn biscuit with queequeg salam before -PRON- twice or thrice kiss -PRON- nose and that do -PRON- undress and go to bed at peace with -PRON- own conscience and all the world
chapter_10	how -PRON- be -PRON- know not but there be no place like a bed for confidential disclosure between friend
chapter_10	man and wife -PRON- say there open the very bottom of -PRON- soul to each other and some old couple often lie and chat over old time till nearly morning
chapter_10	thus then in -PRON- heart honeymoon lie -PRON- and queequeg a cosy love pair
chapter_11	nightgown
chapter_11	-PRON- have lie thus in bed chat and nap at short interval and queequeg now and then affectionately throw -PRON- brown tattooed leg over mine and then draw -PRON- back so entirely sociable and free and easy be -PRON- when at last by reason of -PRON- confabulation what little nappishness remain in -PRON- altogether depart and -PRON- feel like get up again though day break be yet some way down the future
chapter_11	yes -PRON- become very wakeful so much so that -PRON- recumbent position begin to grow wearisome and by little and little -PRON- find -PRON- sit up the clothe well tuck around -PRON- lean against the head board with -PRON- four knee draw up close together and -PRON- two nose bend over -PRON- as if -PRON- kneepan be warm pan
chapter_11	-PRON- feel very nice and snug the more so since -PRON- be so chilly out of door indeed out of bed clothe too see that there be no fire in the room
chapter_11	the more so -PRON- say because truly to enjoy bodily warmth some small part of -PRON- must be cold for there be no quality in this world that be not what -PRON- be merely by contrast
chapter_11	nothing exist in -PRON-
chapter_11	but if like queequeg and -PRON- in the bed the tip of -PRON- nose or the crown of -PRON- head be slightly chill why then indeed in the general consciousness -PRON- feel most delightfully and unmistakably warm
chapter_11	for this reason a sleeping apartment should never be furnish with a fire which be one of the luxurious discomfort of the rich
chapter_11	for the height of this sort of deliciousness be to have nothing but the blanket between -PRON- and -PRON- snugness and the cold of the outer air
chapter_11	then there -PRON- lie like the one warm spark in the heart of an arctic crystal
chapter_11	-PRON- have be sit in this crouch manner for some time when all at once -PRON- think -PRON- would open -PRON- eye for when between sheet whether by day or by night and whether asleep or awake -PRON- have a way of always keep -PRON- eye shut in order the more to concentrate the snugness of be in bed
chapter_11	because no man can ever feel -PRON- own identity aright except -PRON- eye be close as if darkness be indeed the proper element of -PRON- essence though light be more congenial to -PRON- clayey part
chapter_11	upon open -PRON- eye then and come out of -PRON- own pleasant and self create darkness into the impose and coarse outer gloom of the unilluminated twelve o'clock at night -PRON- experience a disagreeable revulsion
chapter_11	be -PRON- say that though -PRON- have feel such a strong repugnance to -PRON- smoking in the bed the night before yet see how elastic -PRON- stiff prejudice grow when love once come to bend -PRON-
chapter_11	for now -PRON- like nothing good than to have queequeg smoking by -PRON- even in bed because -PRON- seem to be full of such serene household joy then
chapter_11	-PRON- no more feel unduly concerned for the landlord 's policy of insurance
chapter_11	-PRON- be only alive to the condense confidential comfortableness of share a pipe and a blanket with a real friend
chapter_11	with -PRON- shaggy jacket draw about -PRON- shoulder -PRON- now pass the tomahawk from one to the other till slowly there grow over -PRON- a blue hanging tester of smoke illuminate by the flame of the new light lamp
chapter_11	whether -PRON- be that this undulate tester roll the savage away to far distant scene -PRON- know not but -PRON- now speak of -PRON- native island and eager to hear -PRON- history -PRON- beg -PRON- to go on and tell -PRON-
chapter_12	biographical queequeg be a native of rokovoko an island far away to the west and south
chapter_12	-PRON- be not down in any map true place never be
chapter_12	when a new hatch savage run wild about -PRON- native woodland in a grass clout follow by the nibble goat as if -PRON- be a green sapling even then in queequeg 's ambitious soul lurk a strong desire to see something more of christendom than a specimen whaler or two
chapter_12	there be excellent blood in -PRON- vein royal stuff though sadly vitiate -PRON- fear by the cannibal propensity -PRON- nourish in -PRON- untutored youth
chapter_12	but the ship have -PRON- full complement of seaman spurn -PRON- suit and not all the king -PRON- father 's influence could prevail
chapter_12	but queequeg vow a vow
chapter_12	on one side be a coral reef on the other a low tongue of land cover with mangrove thicket that grow out into the water
chapter_12	in vain the captain threaten to throw -PRON- overboard suspend a cutlass over -PRON- naked wrist queequeg be the son of a king and queequeg budge not
chapter_12	-PRON- put -PRON- down among the sailor and make a whaleman of -PRON-
chapter_12	but like czar peter content to toil in the shipyard of foreign city queequeg disdain no seeming ignominy if thereby -PRON- may happily gain the power of enlighten -PRON- untutored countryman
chapter_12	-PRON- -PRON- be a wicked world in all meridian -PRON- will die a pagan
chapter_12	by hint -PRON- ask -PRON- whether -PRON- do not propose go back and have a coronation since -PRON- may now consider -PRON- father dead and go -PRON- be very old and feeble at the last account
chapter_12	-PRON- answer no not yet and add that -PRON- be fearful christianity or rather christians have unfit -PRON- for ascend the pure and undefiled throne of thirty pagan king before -PRON-
chapter_12	for the nonce however -PRON- propose to sail about and sow -PRON- wild oats in all four ocean
chapter_12	-PRON- have make a harpooneer of -PRON- and that barbed iron be in lieu of a sceptre now
chapter_12	-PRON- answer to go to sea again in -PRON- old vocation
chapter_12	-PRON- at once resolve to accompany -PRON- to that island ship aboard the same vessel get into the same watch the same boat the same mess with -PRON- in short to share -PRON- every hap with both -PRON- hand in -PRON- boldly dip into the potluck of both world
chapter_12	to all this -PRON- joyously assent for besides the affection -PRON- now feel for queequeg -PRON- be an experienced harpooneer and as such could not fail to be of great usefulness to one who like -PRON- be wholly ignorant of the mystery of whaling though well acquaint with the sea as know to merchant seaman
chapter_12	-PRON- story be end with -PRON- pipe 's last die puff queequeg embrace -PRON- press -PRON- forehead against mine and blow out the light -PRON- roll over from each other this way and that and very soon be sleep
chapter_13	wheelbarrow
chapter_13	next morning monday after dispose of the embalm head to a barber for a block -PRON- settle -PRON- own and comrade 's bill use however -PRON- comrade 's money
chapter_13	-PRON- borrow a wheelbarrow and embark -PRON- thing include -PRON- own poor carpet bag and queequeg 's canvas sack and hammock away -PRON- go down to the moss the little nantucket packet schooner moor at the wharf
chapter_13	as -PRON- be go along the people star not at queequeg so much for -PRON- be use to see cannibal like -PRON- in -PRON- street but at see -PRON- and -PRON- upon such confidential term
chapter_13	but -PRON- heed -PRON- not go along wheel the barrow by turn and queequeg now and then stop to adjust the sheath on -PRON- harpoon barb
chapter_13	-PRON- ask -PRON- why -PRON- carry such a troublesome thing with -PRON- ashore and whether all whaling ship do not find -PRON- own harpoon
chapter_13	to this in substance -PRON- reply that though what -PRON- hint be true enough yet -PRON- have a particular affection for -PRON- own harpoon because -PRON- be of assure stuff well try in many a mortal combat and deeply intimate with the heart of whale
chapter_13	in short like many inland reaper and mower who go into the farmer meadow armed with -PRON- own scythe though in no wise oblige to furnish -PRON- even so queequeg for -PRON- own private reason prefer -PRON- own harpoon
chapter_13	shift the barrow from -PRON- hand to -PRON- -PRON- tell -PRON- a funny story about the first wheelbarrow -PRON- have ever see

chapter_15	queequeg say -PRON- do -PRON- think that -PRON- can make out a supper for -PRON- both on one clam
chapter_15	
chapter_15	however a warm savory steam from the kitchen serve to belie the apparently cheerless prospect before -PRON-
chapter_15	-PRON- be make of small juicy clam scarcely big than hazel nut mix with pound ship biscuit and salted pork cut up into little flake the whole enrich with butter and plentifully season with pepper and salt
chapter_15	-PRON- appetite be sharpen by the frosty voyage and in particular queequeg see -PRON- favourite fishing food before -PRON- and the chowder be surpassingly excellent -PRON- despatch -PRON- with great expedition when lean back a moment and bethink -PRON- of mrs. hussey 's clam and cod announcement -PRON- think -PRON- would try a little experiment
chapter_15	-PRON- resume business and while ply -PRON- spoon in the bowl think -PRON- to -PRON- -PRON- wonder now if this here have any effect on the head
chapter_15	that stultifying say about chowder head people
chapter_15	but look queequeg be not that a live eel in -PRON- bowl
chapter_15	where be -PRON- harpoon
chapter_15	fishiest of all fishy place be the try pot which well deserve -PRON- name for the pot there be always boil chowder
chapter_15	chowder for breakfast and chowder for dinner and chowder for supper till -PRON- begin to look for fish bone come through -PRON- clothe

chapter_15	mrs. hussey wear a polished necklace of codfish vertebra and hosea hussey have -PRON- account book bind in superior old shark skin
chapter_15	there be a fishy flavor to the milk too which -PRON- could not at all account for till one morning happen to take a stroll along the beach among some fisherman 's boat -PRON- see hosea 's brindled cow feed on fish remnant and march along the sand with each foot in a cod 's decapitated head look very slip shod -PRON- assure ye
chapter_15	supper conclude -PRON- receive a lamp and direction from mrs. hussey concern the near way to bed but as queequeg be about to precede -PRON- up the stair the lady reach forth -PRON- arm and demand -PRON- harpoon -PRON- allow no harpoon in -PRON- chamber
chapter_15	why not say -PRON- every true whaleman sleep with -PRON- harpoon but why not
chapter_15	because -PRON- be dangerous say -PRON-
chapter_15	ever since young stiggs come from that unfort'nt v'y'ge of -PRON- when -PRON- be go four year and a half with only three barrel of ile be find dead in -PRON- first floor back with -PRON- harpoon in -PRON- side ever since then -PRON- allow no boarder to take sich dangerous weepon in -PRON- room at night
chapter_15	so mr. queequeg for -PRON- have learn -PRON- name -PRON- will just take this here iron and keep -PRON- for -PRON- till morning
chapter_15	but the chowder clam or cod to morrow for breakfast man
chapter_15	
chapter_16	in bed -PRON- concoct -PRON- plan for the morrow
chapter_16	but to -PRON- surprise and no small concern queequeg now give -PRON- to understand that -PRON- have be diligently consult yojo the name of -PRON- black little god and yojo have tell -PRON- two or three time over and strongly insist upon -PRON- everyway that instead of -PRON- go together among the whaling fleet in harbor and in concert select -PRON- craft instead of this -PRON- say yojo earnestly enjoin that the selection of the ship should rest wholly with -PRON- inasmuch as yojo purpose befriend -PRON- and in order to do so have already pitch upon a vessel which if leave to -PRON- -PRON- ishmael should infallibly light upon for all the world as though -PRON- have turn out by chance and in that vessel -PRON- must immediately ship -PRON- for the present irrespective of queequeg
chapter_16	-PRON- have forget to mention that in many thing queequeg place great confidence in the excellence of yojo 's judgment and surprising forecast of thing and cherish yojo with considerable esteem as a rather good sort of god who perhaps mean well enough upon the whole but in all case do not succeed in -PRON- benevolent design
chapter_16	now this plan of queequeg 's or rather yojo 's touch the selection of -PRON- craft -PRON- do not like that plan at all
chapter_16	-PRON- have not a little rely upon queequeg 's sagacity to point out the whaler best fit to carry -PRON- and -PRON- fortune securely
chapter_16	but as all -PRON- remonstrance produce no effect upon queequeg -PRON- be oblige to acquiesce and accordingly prepare to set about this business with a determined rush sort of energy and vigor that should quickly settle that trifling little affair
chapter_16	next morning early leave queequeg shut up with yojo in -PRON- little bedroom for -PRON- seem that -PRON- be some sort of lent or ramadan or day of fasting humiliation and prayer with queequeg and yojo that day how -PRON- be -PRON- never could find out for though -PRON- apply -PRON- to -PRON- several time -PRON- never could master -PRON- liturgy and xxxix articles leave queequeg then fast on -PRON- tomahawk pipe and yojo warm -PRON- at -PRON- sacrificial fire of shaving -PRON- sally out among the shipping
chapter_16	the devil dam the tit bit and the pequod
chapter_16	pequod -PRON- will no doubt remember be the name of a celebrated tribe of massachusetts indians now extinct as the ancient medes
chapter_16	-PRON- may have see many a quaint craft in -PRON- day for aught -PRON- know square toed lugger mountainous japanese junk butter box galliot and what not but take -PRON- word for -PRON- -PRON- never see such a rare old craft as this same rare old pequod
chapter_16	-PRON- be a ship of the old school rather small if anything with an old fashioned claw footed look about -PRON-
chapter_16	long seasoned and weather stain in the typhoon and calm of all four ocean -PRON- old hull 's complexion be darken like a french grenadier 's who have alike fight in egypt and siberia
chapter_16	-PRON- mast cut somewhere on the coast of japan where -PRON- original one be lose overboard in a gale -PRON- mast stand stiffly up like the spine of the three old king of cologne
chapter_16	but to all these -PRON- old antiquity be add new and marvellous feature pertain to the wild business that for more than half a century -PRON- have follow
chapter_16	old captain peleg many year -PRON- chief mate before -PRON- command another vessel of -PRON- own and now a retire seaman and one of the principal owner of the pequod this old peleg during the term of -PRON- chief mateship have build upon -PRON- original grotesqueness and inlaid -PRON- all over with a quaintness both of material and device unmatched by anything except -PRON- be thorkill hake 's carve buckler or bedstead
chapter_16	-PRON- be apparell like any barbaric ethiopian emperor -PRON- neck heavy with pendant of polished ivory
chapter_16	those thew run not through base block of land wood but deftly travel over sheaf of sea ivory
chapter_16	the helmsman who steer by that tiller in a tempest feel like the tartar when -PRON- hold back -PRON- fiery steed by clutch -PRON- jaw
chapter_16	a noble craft but somehow a most melancholy
chapter_16	all noble thing be touch with that
chapter_16	now when -PRON- look about the quarter deck for some one have authority in order to propose -PRON- as a candidate for the voyage at first -PRON- see nobody but -PRON- could not well overlook a strange sort of tent or rather wigwam pitch a little behind the main mast
chapter_16	a triangular opening face towards the bow of the ship so that the insider command a complete view forward
chapter_16	and half conceal in this queer tenement -PRON- at length find one who by -PRON- aspect seem to have authority and who -PRON- be noon and the ship 's work suspend be now enjoy respite from the burden of command
chapter_16	there be nothing so very particular perhaps about the appearance of the elderly man -PRON- see -PRON- be brown and brawny like most old seaman and heavily roll up in blue pilot cloth cut in the quaker style only there be a fine and almost microscopic net work of the minute wrinkle interlace round -PRON- eye which must have arise from -PRON- continual sailing in many hard gale and always look to windward for this cause the muscle about the eye to become purse together
chapter_16	such eye wrinkle be very effectual in a scowl
chapter_16	-PRON- demand
chapter_16	-PRON- be think of shipping
chapter_16	
chapter_16	thou wast wast thou
chapter_16	no nantucketer ever be in a stove boat
chapter_16	
chapter_16	no sir -PRON- never have
chapter_16	dost know nothing at all about whaling -PRON- dare say
chapter_16	eh nothing sir but -PRON- have no doubt -PRON- shall soon learn
chapter_16	-PRON- have be several voyage in the merchant service and -PRON- think that-- merchant service be damned
chapter_16	talk not that lingo to -PRON-
chapter_16	i'll take that leg away from thy stern if ever thou talk of the marchant service to -PRON- again
chapter_16	marchant service indeed
chapter_16	-PRON- suppose now ye feel considerable proud of have serve in those marchant ship
chapter_16	but fluke
chapter_16	man what make thee want to go a whaling eh -PRON- look a little suspicious do not -PRON- eh hast not be a pirate hast thou
chapter_16	dost not think of murder the officer when thou gettest to sea
chapter_16	but what take thee a whaling
chapter_16	-PRON- want to know that before -PRON- think of ship ye
chapter_16	
chapter_16	well sir -PRON- want to see what whaling be
chapter_16	want to see what whaling be eh
chapter_16	
chapter_16	who be captain ahab sir
chapter_16	aye aye -PRON- think so
chapter_16	captain ahab be the captain of this ship
chapter_16	
chapter_16	thou art speak to captain peleg that be who ye be speak to young man
chapter_16	-PRON- belong to -PRON- and captain bildad to see the pequod fit out for the voyage and supply with all -PRON- need include crew
chapter_16	clap eye on captain ahab young man and thou wilt find that -PRON- have only one leg
chapter_16	
chapter_16	what do -PRON- mean sir
chapter_16	be the other one lose by a whale
chapter_16	lose by a whale
chapter_16	young man come nearer to -PRON- -PRON- be devour chew up crunch by the monstrous parmacetty that ever chip a boat!--ah ah
chapter_16	-PRON- be a little alarm by -PRON- energy perhaps also a little touched at the hearty grief in -PRON- conclude exclamation but say as calmly as -PRON- could what -PRON- say be no doubt true enough sir but how could -PRON- know there be any peculiar ferocity in that particular whale though indeed -PRON- may have infer as much from the simple fact of the accident
chapter_16	
chapter_16	sir say -PRON- -PRON- think -PRON- tell -PRON- that -PRON- have be four voyage in the merchant-- hard down out of that
chapter_16	mind what -PRON- say about the marchant service
chapter_16	don't aggravate -PRON- -PRON- will not have -PRON-
chapter_16	-PRON- have give thee a hint about what whaling be do ye yet feel inclined for -PRON-
chapter_16	
chapter_16	
chapter_16	very good
chapter_16	-PRON- be sir if -PRON- should be positively indispensable to do so not to be get rid of that is
chapter_16	
chapter_16	good again
chapter_16	-PRON- think so
chapter_16	well then just step forward there and take a peep over the weather bow and then back to -PRON- and tell -PRON- what ye see there
chapter_16	for a moment -PRON- stand a little puzzled by this curious request not know exactly how to take -PRON- whether humorously or in earnest
chapter_16	but concentrate all -PRON- crow 's foot into one scowl captain peleg start -PRON- on the errand
chapter_16	go forward and glance over the weather bow -PRON- perceive that the ship swing to -PRON- anchor with the flood tide be now obliquely point towards the open ocean
chapter_16	the prospect be unlimited but exceedingly monotonous and forbidding not the slight variety that -PRON- could see
chapter_16	well what be the report
chapter_16	say peleg when -PRON- come back what do ye see
chapter_16	"not much -PRON- replied--""noth but water considerable horizon though and there be a squall come up -PRON- think"
chapter_16	
chapter_16	well what do thou think then of see the world
chapter_16	do ye wish to go round cape horn to see any more of -PRON- eh
chapter_16	-PRON- be a little staggered but go a whaling -PRON- must and -PRON- would and the pequod be as good a ship as any
chapter_16	-PRON- think the good and all this -PRON- now repeat to peleg
chapter_16	see -PRON- so determined -PRON- express -PRON- willingness to ship -PRON-
chapter_16	"and thou mayest as well sign the paper right off -PRON- added--""come along with ye"
chapter_16	and so say -PRON- lead the way below deck into the cabin
chapter_16	seated on the transom be what seem to -PRON- a most uncommon and surprising figure
chapter_16	-PRON- turn out to be captain bildad who along with captain peleg be one of the large owner of the vessel the other share as be sometimes the case in these port be hold by a crowd of old annuitant widow fatherless child and chancery ward each own about the value of a timber head or a foot of plank or a nail or two in the ship
chapter_16	people in nantucket invest -PRON- money in whaling vessel the same way that -PRON- do -PRON- in approve state stock bring in good interest
chapter_16	-PRON- be fight quakers -PRON- be quakers with a vengeance
chapter_16	so that there be instance among -PRON- of man who name with scripture name a singularly common fashion on the island and in childhood naturally imbibe the stately dramatic thee and thou of the quaker idiom still from the audacious daring and boundless adventure of -PRON- subsequent life strangely blend with these unoutgrown peculiarity a thousand bold dash of character not unworthy a scandinavian sea king or a poetical pagan roman
chapter_16	and when these thing unite in a man of greatly superior natural force with a globular brain and a ponderous heart who have also by the stillness and seclusion of many long night watch in the remote water and beneath constellation never see here at the north be lead to think untraditionally and independently receive all nature 's sweet or savage impression fresh from -PRON- own virgin voluntary and confide breast and thereby chiefly but with some help from accidental advantage to learn a bold and nervous lofty language that man make one in a whole nation 's census a mighty pageant creature form for noble tragedy
chapter_16	nor will -PRON- at all detract from -PRON- dramatically regard if either by birth or other circumstance -PRON- have what seem a half wilful overrule morbidness at the bottom of -PRON- nature
chapter_16	for all man tragically great be make so through a certain morbidness
chapter_16	be sure of this o young ambition all mortal greatness be but disease
chapter_16	but as yet -PRON- have not to do with such an one but with quite another and still a man who if indeed peculiar -PRON- only result again from another phase of the quaker modify by individual circumstance
chapter_16	like captain peleg captain bildad be a well to do retired whaleman
chapter_16	but unlike captain peleg who care not a rush for what be call serious thing and indeed deem those self same serious thing the veriest of all trifle
chapter_16	captain bildad have not only be originally educate accord to the strict sect of nantucket quakerism but all -PRON- subsequent ocean life and the sight of many unclad lovely island creature round the horn all that have not move this native bear quaker one single jot have not so much as alter one angle of -PRON- vest
chapter_16	still for all this immutableness be there some lack of common consistency about worthy captain peleg
chapter_16	though refuse from conscientious scruple to bear arm against land invader yet -PRON- have illimitably invade the atlantic and pacific and though a swear foe to human bloodshed yet have -PRON- in -PRON- straight bodied coat spill tun upon tun of leviathan gore
chapter_16	this world pay dividend
chapter_16	rise from a little cabin boy in short clothe of the drab drab to a harpooneer in a broad shad bellied waistcoat from that become boat header chief mate and captain and finally a ship owner bildad as -PRON- hint before have conclude -PRON- adventurous career by wholly retire from active life at the goodly age of sixty and dedicate -PRON- remain day to the quiet receiving of -PRON- well earn income
chapter_16	now bildad -PRON- be sorry to say have the reputation of be an incorrigible old hunk and in -PRON- sea go day a bitter hard task master
chapter_16	-PRON- tell -PRON- in nantucket though -PRON- certainly seem a curious story that when -PRON- sail the old categut whaleman -PRON- crew upon arrive home be mostly all carry ashore to the hospital sore exhausted and wear out
chapter_16	for a pious man especially for a quaker -PRON- be certainly rather hard hearted to say the least
chapter_16	when bildad be a chief mate to have -PRON- drab coloured eye intently look at -PRON- make -PRON- feel completely nervous till -PRON- could clutch something a hammer or a marling spike and go to work like mad at something or other never mind what

chapter_16	on -PRON- long gaunt body -PRON- carry no spare flesh no superfluous beard -PRON- chin have a soft economical nap to -PRON- like the worn nap of -PRON- broad brimmed hat
chapter_16	such then be the person that -PRON- see seat on the transom when -PRON- follow captain peleg down into the cabin
chapter_16	-PRON- broad brim be place beside -PRON- -PRON- leg be stiffly cross -PRON- drab vesture be button up to -PRON- chin and spectacle on nose -PRON- seem absorb in read from a ponderous volume
chapter_16	bildad cry captain peleg at -PRON- again bildad eh
chapter_16	ye have be study those scripture now for the last thirty year to -PRON- certain knowledge
chapter_16	how far ye get bildad
chapter_16	as if long habituate to such profane talk from -PRON- old shipmate bildad without notice -PRON- present irreverence quietly look up and see -PRON- glance again inquiringly towards peleg
chapter_16	dost thee
chapter_16	say bildad in a hollow tone and turn round to -PRON-
chapter_16	what do ye think of -PRON- bildad
chapter_16	say peleg
chapter_16	peleg now throw open a chest and draw forth the ship 's article place pen and ink before -PRON- and seat -PRON- at a little table
chapter_16	-PRON- be already aware that in the whaling business -PRON- pay no wage but all hand include the captain receive certain share of the profit call lay and that these lay be proportion to the degree of importance pertain to the respective duty of the ship 's company
chapter_16	-PRON- be also aware that be a green hand at whaling -PRON- own lay would not be very large but consider that -PRON- be use to the sea could steer a ship splice a rope and all that -PRON- make no doubt that from all -PRON- have hear -PRON- should be offer at least the 275th lay that is the 275th part of the clear net proceed of the voyage whatev that may eventually amount to
chapter_16	-PRON- may be think that this be a poor way to accumulate a princely fortune
chapter_16	and so -PRON- be a very poor way indeed
chapter_16	upon the whole -PRON- think that the 275th lay would be about the fair thing but would not have be surprise have -PRON- be offer the 200th consider -PRON- be of a broad shoulder make
chapter_16	but one thing nevertheless that make -PRON- a little distrustful about receive a generous share of the profit be this
chapter_16	ashore -PRON- have hear something of both captain peleg and -PRON- unaccountable old crony bildad how that -PRON- be the principal proprietor of the pequod therefore the other and more inconsiderable and scattered owner leave nearly the whole management of the ship 's affair to these two
chapter_16	and -PRON- do not know
chapter_16	but what the stingy old bildad may have a mighty deal to say about ship hand especially as -PRON- now find -PRON- on board the pequod quite at home there in the cabin and read -PRON- bible as if at -PRON- own fireside
chapter_16	the seven hundred and seventy seventh
chapter_16	well old bildad -PRON- be determine that -PRON- for one shall not lay up many lay here below where moth and rust do corrupt
chapter_16	-PRON- be an exceedingly long lay that indeed and though from the magnitude of the figure -PRON- may at first deceive a landsman yet the slight consideration will show that though seven hundred and seventy seven be a pretty large number yet when -PRON- come to make a teenth of -PRON- -PRON- will then see -PRON- say that the seven hundred and seventy seventh part of a farthing be a good deal less than seven hundred and seventy seven gold doubloon and so -PRON- think at the time
chapter_16	why blast -PRON- eye bildad cry peleg thou dost not want to swindle this young man
chapter_16	-PRON- must have more than that
chapter_16	"seven hundred and seventy seventh again say bildad without lift -PRON- eye and then go on mumbling--""for where -PRON- treasure be there will -PRON- heart be also"
chapter_16	-PRON- be go to put -PRON- down for the three hundredth say peleg do ye hear that bildad
chapter_16	the three hundredth lay -PRON- say
chapter_16	bildad lay down -PRON- book and turn solemnly towards -PRON- say captain peleg thou hast a generous heart but thou must consider the duty thou owest to the other owner of this ship widow and orphan many of -PRON- and that if -PRON- too abundantly reward the labor of this young man -PRON- may be take the bread from those widow and those orphan
chapter_16	thou bildad roar peleg start up and clatter about the cabin
chapter_16	blast ye captain bildad if -PRON- have follow thy advice in these matter -PRON- would afore now have a conscience to lug about that would be heavy enough to founder the large ship that ever sail round cape horn
chapter_16	
chapter_16	captain peleg say bildad steadily thy conscience may be draw ten inch of water or ten fathom -PRON- can not tell but as thou art still an impenitent man captain peleg -PRON- greatly fear lest thy conscience be but a leaky one and will in the end sink thee founder down to the fiery pit captain peleg
chapter_16	fiery pit
chapter_16	fiery pit
chapter_16	ye insult -PRON- man past all natural bearing ye insult -PRON-

chapter_16	bildad say that again to -PRON- and start -PRON- soul bolt but i'll i'll yes -PRON- will swallow a live goat with all -PRON- hair and horn on
chapter_16	out of the cabin ye canting drab coloured son of a wooden gun a straight wake with ye
chapter_16	as -PRON- thunder out this -PRON- make a rush at bildad but with a marvellous oblique slide celerity bildad for that time elude -PRON-
chapter_16	but to -PRON- astonishment -PRON- sit down again on the transom very quietly and seem to have not the slight intention of withdraw
chapter_16	-PRON- seem quite used to impenitent peleg and -PRON- way
chapter_16	as for peleg after let off -PRON- rage as -PRON- have there seem no more leave in -PRON- and -PRON- too sit down like a lamb though -PRON- twitch a little as if still nervously agitated
chapter_16	whew

chapter_16	-PRON- jack knife here need the grindstone
chapter_16	that be -PRON- thank ye bildad

chapter_16	
chapter_16	captain peleg say -PRON- -PRON- have a friend with -PRON- who want to ship too shall -PRON- bring -PRON- down to morrow
chapter_16	to be sure say peleg
chapter_16	fetch -PRON- along and -PRON- will look at -PRON-

chapter_16	and after sign the paper off -PRON- go nothing doubt but that -PRON- have do a good morning 's work and that the pequod be the identical ship that yojo have provide to carry queequeg and -PRON-
chapter_16	but -PRON- have not proceed far when -PRON- begin to bethink -PRON- that the captain with whom -PRON- be to sail yet remain unseen by -PRON- though indeed in many case a whale ship will be completely fit out and receive all -PRON- crew on board ere the captain make -PRON- visible by arrive to take command for sometimes these voyage be so prolonged and the shore interval at home so exceedingly brief that if the captain have a family or any absorb concernment of that sort -PRON- do not trouble -PRON- much about -PRON- ship in port but leave -PRON- to the owner till all be ready for sea
chapter_16	however -PRON- be always as well to have a look at -PRON- before irrevocably commit -PRON- into -PRON- hand
chapter_16	turn back
chapter_16	and what dost thou want of captain ahab
chapter_16	
chapter_16	
chapter_16	yes but -PRON- should like to see -PRON-
chapter_16	but -PRON- do not think thou wilt be able to at present
chapter_16	-PRON- do not know exactly what be the matter with -PRON- but -PRON- keep close inside the house a sort of sick and yet -PRON- do not look so
chapter_16	any how young man -PRON- will not always see -PRON- so -PRON- do not suppose -PRON- will thee
chapter_16	-PRON- be a queer man captain ahab so some think but a good one

chapter_16	
chapter_16	come hither to -PRON- hither hither say peleg with a significance in -PRON- eye that almost startle -PRON-
chapter_16	captain ahab do not name -PRON-
chapter_16	twas a foolish ignorant whim of -PRON- crazy widowed mother who die when -PRON- be only a twelvemonth old
chapter_16	and yet the old squaw tistig at gayhead say that the name would somehow prove prophetic
chapter_16	-PRON- be a lie
chapter_16	-PRON- know captain ahab well -PRON- have sail with -PRON- as mate year ago -PRON- know what -PRON- be a good man not a pious good man like bildad but a swear good man something like -PRON-
chapter_16	only there be a good deal more of -PRON-
chapter_16	aye aye -PRON- know that -PRON- be never very jolly and -PRON- know that on the passage home -PRON- be a little out of -PRON- mind for a spell but -PRON- be the sharp shooting pain in -PRON- bleeding stump that bring that about as any one may see
chapter_16	-PRON- know too that ever since -PRON- lose -PRON- leg last voyage by that accursed whale -PRON- be be a kind of moody desperate moody and savage sometimes but that will all pass off
chapter_16	and once for all let -PRON- tell thee and assure thee young man -PRON- be good to sail with a moody good captain than a laugh bad one
chapter_16	so good bye to thee and wrong not captain ahab because -PRON- happen to have a wicked name
chapter_16	besides -PRON- boy -PRON- have a wife not three voyage wed a sweet resign girl
chapter_16	think of that by that sweet girl that old man have a child hold ye then there can be any utter hopeless harm in ahab
chapter_16	no no -PRON- lad stricken blast
chapter_16	if -PRON- be ahab have -PRON- humanity
chapter_16	as -PRON- walk away -PRON- be full of thoughtfulness what have be incidentally reveal to -PRON- of captain ahab fill -PRON- with a certain wild vagueness of painfulness concern -PRON-
chapter_16	and yet -PRON- also feel a strange awe of -PRON- but that sort of awe which -PRON- can not at all describe be not exactly awe -PRON- do not know what -PRON- be
chapter_16	but -PRON- feel -PRON- and -PRON- do not disincline -PRON- towards -PRON- though -PRON- feel impatience at what seem like mystery in -PRON- so imperfectly as -PRON- be know to -PRON- then
chapter_17	the ramadan
chapter_17	as queequeg 's ramadan or fasting and humiliation be to continue all day -PRON- do not choose to disturb -PRON- till towards night fall for -PRON- cherish the great respect towards everybody 's religious obligation never mind how comical and could not find -PRON- in -PRON- heart to undervalue even a congregation of ant worship a toad stool or those other creature in certain part of -PRON- earth who with a degree of footmanism quite unprecedented in other planet bow down before the torso of a deceased land proprietor merely on account of the inordinate possession yet own and rent in -PRON- name
chapter_17	-PRON- say -PRON- good presbyterian christians should be charitable in these thing and not fancy -PRON- so vastly superior to other mortal pagan and what not because of -PRON- half crazy conceit on these subject
chapter_17	there be queequeg now certainly entertain the most absurd notion about yojo and -PRON- ramadan but what of that
chapter_17	queequeg think -PRON- know what -PRON- be about -PRON- suppose -PRON- seem to be content and there let -PRON- rest
chapter_17	all -PRON- argue with -PRON- would not avail let -PRON- be -PRON- say and heaven have mercy on -PRON- all presbyterians and pagans alike for -PRON- be all somehow dreadfully crack about the head and sadly need mending
chapter_17	-PRON- try to open -PRON- but -PRON- be fasten inside
chapter_17	-PRON- say queequeg why do not -PRON- speak
chapter_17	-PRON- be -PRON- ishmael
chapter_17	-PRON- begin to grow alarm
chapter_17	-PRON- have allow -PRON- such abundant time -PRON- think -PRON- may have have an apoplectic fit
chapter_17	-PRON- look through the key hole but the door opening into an odd corner of the room the key hole prospect be but a crooked and sinister one
chapter_17	-PRON- could only see part of the foot board of the bed and a line of the wall but nothing more
chapter_17	-PRON- be surprised to behold rest against the wall the wooden shaft of queequeg 's harpoon which the landlady the evening previous have take from -PRON- before -PRON- mount to the chamber
chapter_17	that be strange think -PRON- but at any rate since the harpoon stand yonder and -PRON- seldom or never go abroad without -PRON- therefore -PRON- must be inside here and no possible mistake
chapter_17	"queequeg!--queequeg!""--all still"
chapter_17	something must have happen

chapter_17	and with that -PRON- seize -PRON- arm
chapter_17	what be the matter with -PRON-
chapter_17	what be the matter with -PRON- shipmate
chapter_17	in as calm but rapid a manner as possible -PRON- give -PRON- to understand the whole case
chapter_17	"unconsciously clap the vinegar cruet to one side of -PRON- nose -PRON- ruminate for an instant then exclaimed--""no"
chapter_17	-PRON- have not see -PRON- since -PRON- put -PRON- there

chapter_17	what be that noise there
chapter_17	-PRON- young man avast there
chapter_17	-PRON- do not allow -PRON- -PRON- will not have -PRON- premise spoiled
chapter_17	go for the locksmith there be one about a mile from here
chapter_17	but avast
chapter_17	put -PRON- hand in -PRON- side pocket here be a key that will fit -PRON- guess let -PRON- see
chapter_17	and with that -PRON- turn -PRON- in the lock but alas
chapter_17	queequeg 's supplemental bolt remain unwithdrawn within
chapter_17	have to burst -PRON- open say -PRON- and be run down the entry a little for a good start when the landlady catch at -PRON- again vow -PRON- should not break down -PRON- premise but -PRON- tear from -PRON- and with a sudden bodily rush dash -PRON- full against the mark
chapter_17	there sit queequeg altogether cool and self collect right in the middle of the room squat on -PRON- ham and hold yojo on top of -PRON- head
chapter_17	-PRON- look neither one way nor the other way but sit like a carve image with scarce a sign of active life
chapter_17	
chapter_17	-PRON- hain't be a sittin so all day have -PRON-
chapter_17	say the landlady
chapter_17	but all -PRON- say not a word could -PRON- drag out of -PRON- -PRON- almost feel like push -PRON- over so as to change -PRON- position for -PRON- be almost intolerable -PRON- seem so painfully and unnaturally constrained especially as in all probability -PRON- have be sit so for upwards of eight or ten hour go too without -PRON- regular meal
chapter_17	mrs. hussey say -PRON- -PRON- be alive at all event so leave -PRON- if -PRON- please and -PRON- will see to this strange affair -PRON-
chapter_17	-PRON- wonder think -PRON- if this can possibly be a part of -PRON- ramadan do -PRON- fast on -PRON- ham that way in -PRON- native island
chapter_17	-PRON- ramadan only come once a year and -PRON- do not believe -PRON- be very punctual then
chapter_17	after sit a long time listen to the long story of some sailor who have just come from a plum pudding voyage as -PRON- call -PRON- that is a short whaling voyage in a schooner or brig confine to the north of the line in the atlantic ocean only after listen to these plum puddinger till nearly eleven o'clock -PRON- go up stair to go to bed feel quite sure by this time
chapter_17	queequeg must certainly have bring -PRON- ramadan to a termination
chapter_17	but no there -PRON- be just where -PRON- have leave -PRON- -PRON- have not stir an inch
chapter_17	-PRON- begin to grow vex with -PRON- -PRON- seem so downright senseless and insane to be sit there all day and half the night on -PRON- ham in a cold room hold a piece of wood on -PRON- head
chapter_17	for heaven 's sake queequeg get up and shake -PRON- get up and have some supper
chapter_17	but not a word do -PRON- reply
chapter_17	despairing of -PRON- therefore -PRON- determine to go to bed and to sleep and no doubt before a great while -PRON- would follow -PRON-
chapter_17	but previous to turn in -PRON- take -PRON- heavy bearskin jacket and throw -PRON- over -PRON- as -PRON- promise to be a very cold night and -PRON- have nothing but -PRON- ordinary round jacket on
chapter_17	for some time do all -PRON- would -PRON- could not get into the faint doze
chapter_17	think of -PRON- sleep all night in the same room with a wide awake pagan on -PRON- ham in this dreary unaccountable ramadan
chapter_17	but somehow -PRON- drop off at last and know nothing more till break of day when look over the bedside there squat queequeg as if -PRON- have be screw down to the floor
chapter_17	but as soon as the first glimpse of sun enter the window up -PRON- get with stiff and grate joint but with a cheerful look limp towards -PRON- where -PRON- lay press -PRON- forehead again against mine and say -PRON- ramadan be over
chapter_17	queequeg say -PRON- get into bed now and lie and listen to -PRON-
chapter_17	-PRON- then go on begin with the rise and progress of the primitive religion and come down to the various religion of the present time during which time -PRON- labor to show queequeg that all these lents ramadans and prolonged ham squatting in cold cheerless room be stark nonsense bad for the health useless for the soul oppose in short to the obvious law of hygiene and common sense
chapter_17	-PRON- tell -PRON- too that -PRON- be in other thing such an extremely sensible and sagacious savage -PRON- pain -PRON- very badly pain -PRON- to see -PRON- now so deplorably foolish about this ridiculous ramadan of -PRON-
chapter_17	besides argue -PRON- fasting make the body cave in hence the spirit cave in and all thought bear of a fast must necessarily be half starve
chapter_17	this be the reason why most dyspeptic religionist cherish such melancholy notion about -PRON- hereafter
chapter_17	-PRON- say no only upon one memorable occasion
chapter_17	-PRON- be after a great feast give by -PRON- father the king on the gaining of a great battle wherein fifty of the enemy have be kill by about two o'clock in the afternoon and all cook and eat that very evening
chapter_17	no more queequeg say -PRON- shudder that will do for -PRON- know the inference without -PRON- further hint -PRON-
chapter_17	-PRON- have see a sailor who have visit that very island and -PRON- tell -PRON- that -PRON- be the custom when a great battle have be gain there to barbecue all the slain in the yard or garden of the victor and then one by one -PRON- be place in great wooden trencher and garnish round like a pilau with breadfruit and cocoanut and with some parsley in -PRON- mouth be send round with the victor 's compliment to all -PRON- friend just as though these present be so many christmas turkey
chapter_17	after all -PRON- do not think that -PRON- remark about religion make much impression upon queequeg
chapter_17	because in the first place -PRON- somehow seem dull of hear on that important subject unless consider from -PRON- own point of view and in the second place -PRON- do not more than one third understand -PRON- couch -PRON- idea simply as -PRON- would and finally -PRON- no doubt think -PRON- know a good deal more about the true religion than -PRON- do
chapter_17	-PRON- look at -PRON- with a sort of condescending concern and compassion as though -PRON- think -PRON- a great pity that such a sensible young man should be so hopelessly lost to evangelical pagan piety
chapter_18	-PRON- mark
chapter_18	as -PRON- be walk down the end of the wharf towards the ship queequeg carry -PRON- harpoon captain peleg in -PRON- gruff voice loudly hail -PRON- from -PRON- wigwam say -PRON- have not suspect -PRON- friend be a cannibal and furthermore announce that -PRON- let no cannibal on board that craft unless -PRON- previously produce -PRON- paper

chapter_19	
chapter_19	come along queequeg let -PRON- leave this crazy man
chapter_19	but stop tell -PRON- -PRON- name will -PRON-
chapter_19	elijah
chapter_19	elijah think -PRON- and -PRON- walk away both comment after each other 's fashion upon this ragged old sailor and agree that -PRON- be nothing but a humbug try to be a bugbear
chapter_19	but -PRON- have not go perhaps above a hundred yard when chance to turn a corner and look back as -PRON- do so who should be see but elijah follow -PRON- though at a distance
chapter_19	somehow the sight of -PRON- strike -PRON- so that -PRON- say nothing to queequeg of -PRON- be behind but pass on with -PRON- comrade anxious to see whether the stranger would turn the same corner that -PRON- do
chapter_19	-PRON- do and then -PRON- seem to -PRON- that -PRON- be dog -PRON- but with what intent -PRON- could not for the life of -PRON- imagine
chapter_19	this circumstance couple with -PRON- ambiguous half hint half reveal shroud sort of talk now beget in -PRON- all kind of vague wonderment and half apprehension and all connect with the pequod and captain ahab and the leg -PRON- have lose and the cape horn fit and the silver calabash and what captain peleg have say of -PRON- when -PRON- leave the ship the day previous and the prediction of the squaw tistig and the voyage -PRON- have bind -PRON- to sail and a hundred other shadowy thing
chapter_19	-PRON- be resolve to satisfy -PRON- whether this ragged elijah be really dog -PRON- or not and with that intent cross the way with queequeg and on that side of -PRON- retrace -PRON- step
chapter_19	but elijah pass on without seem to notice -PRON-
chapter_20	all
chapter_20	not only be the old sail be mend but new sail be come on board and bolt of canvas and coil of rigging in short everything betoken that the ship 's preparation be hurry to a close
chapter_20	bildad do all the purchasing and provide at the store and the man employ in the hold and on the rigging be work till long after night fall
chapter_20	on the day follow queequeg 's sign the article word be give at all the inn where the ship 's company be stop that -PRON- chest must be on board before night for there be no tell how soon the vessel may be sail
chapter_20	but -PRON- seem -PRON- always give very long notice in these case and the ship do not sail for several day
chapter_20	but no wonder there be a good deal to be do and there be no tell how many thing to be think of before the pequod be fully equip
chapter_20	every one know what a multitude of thing bed sauce pan knife and fork shovel and tong napkin nut cracker and what not be indispensable to the business of housekeeping
chapter_20	and though this also hold true of merchant vessel yet not by any mean to the same extent as with whaleman
chapter_20	for besides the great length of the whaling voyage the numerous article peculiar to the prosecution of the fishery and the impossibility of replace -PRON- at the remote harbor usually frequent -PRON- must be remember that of all ship whaling vessel be the most exposed to accident of all kind and especially to the destruction and loss of the very thing upon which the success of the voyage most depend
chapter_20	at the period of -PRON- arrival at the island the heavy storage of the pequod have be almost complete comprise -PRON- beef bread water fuel and iron hoop and stave
chapter_20	at one time -PRON- would come on board with a jar of pickle for the steward 's pantry another time with a bunch of quill for the chief mate 's desk where -PRON- keep -PRON- log a third time with a roll of flannel for the small of some one 's rheumatic back
chapter_20	never do any woman better deserve -PRON- name which be charity aunt charity as everybody call -PRON-
chapter_20	and like a sister of charity do this charitable aunt charity bustle about hither and thither ready to turn -PRON- hand and heart to anything that promise to yield safety comfort and consolation to all on board a ship in which -PRON- beloved brother bildad be concerned and in which -PRON- -PRON- own a score or two of well save dollar
chapter_20	but -PRON- be startling to see this excellent hearted quakeress come on board as -PRON- do the last day with a long oil ladle in one hand and a still long whaling lance in the other
chapter_20	nor be bildad -PRON- nor captain peleg at all backward
chapter_20	as for bildad -PRON- carry about with -PRON- a long list of the article need and at every fresh arrival down go -PRON- mark opposite that article upon the paper
chapter_20	every once in a while peleg come hobble out of -PRON- whalebone den roaring at the man down the hatchway roar up to the rigger at the mast head and then conclude by roar back into -PRON- wigwam
chapter_20	during these day of preparation queequeg and -PRON- often visit the craft and as often -PRON- ask about captain ahab and how -PRON- be and when -PRON- be go to come on board -PRON- ship
chapter_20	but when a man suspect any wrong -PRON- sometimes happen that if -PRON- be already involve in the matter -PRON- insensibly strive to cover up -PRON- suspicion even from -PRON-
chapter_20	and much this way -PRON- be with -PRON-
chapter_20	at last -PRON- be give out that some time next day the ship would certainly sail
chapter_21	go aboard
chapter_21	-PRON- be nearly six o'clock but only grey imperfect misty dawn when -PRON- draw nigh
chapter_21	the wharf

chapter_21	avast cry a voice whose owner at the same time come close behind -PRON- lay a hand upon both -PRON- shoulder and then insinuate -PRON- between -PRON- stand stoop forward a little in the uncertain twilight strangely peer from queequeg to -PRON-

chapter_21	never mind -PRON- say -PRON- queequeg come on
chapter_21	"but -PRON- steal up to -PRON- again and suddenly clap -PRON- hand on -PRON- shoulder said--""did ye see anything look like man go towards that ship a while ago"
chapter_21

chapter_21	shall not see ye again very soon -PRON- guess unless -PRON- be before the grand jury
chapter_21	at last step on board the pequod -PRON- find everything in profound quiet not a soul move
chapter_21	the cabin entrance be lock within the hatch be all on and lumber with coil of rigging
chapter_21	see a light -PRON- go down and find only an old rigger there wrap in a tattered pea jacket
chapter_21	-PRON- be throw at whole length upon two chest -PRON- face downwards and inclose in -PRON- folded arm
chapter_21	the profound slumber sleep upon -PRON-
chapter_21	but -PRON- seem that when on the wharf queequeg have not at all notice what -PRON- now allude to hence -PRON- would have think -PRON- to have be optically deceive in that matter be -PRON- not for elijah 's otherwise inexplicable question
chapter_21	but -PRON- beat the thing down and again mark the sleeper jocularly hint to queequeg that perhaps -PRON- have best sit up with the body tell -PRON- to establish -PRON- accordingly
chapter_21	oh
chapter_21	perry dood seat say queequeg -PRON- country way will not hurt -PRON- face

chapter_21	get off queequeg
chapter_21	look -PRON- will twitch -PRON- off soon
chapter_21	-PRON- wonder -PRON- do not wake
chapter_21	
chapter_21	-PRON- keep the pipe pass over the sleeper from one to the other
chapter_21	what be that for queequeg
chapter_21	perry easy kill e oh perry easy
chapter_21	shipped man answer -PRON- when do -PRON- sail
chapter_21	
chapter_21	aye aye ye be go in -PRON- be ye
chapter_21	
chapter_21	who but -PRON- indeed -PRON- be go to ask -PRON- some further question concern ahab when -PRON- hear a noise on deck
chapter_21	holloa
chapter_21	starbuck 's astir say the rigger
chapter_21	-PRON- be a lively chief mate that good man and a pious but all alive now -PRON- must turn to
chapter_21	and so say -PRON- go on deck and -PRON- follow
chapter_21	-PRON- be now clear sunrise
chapter_21	soon the crew come on board in two and three the rigger bestir -PRON- the mate be actively engaged and several of the shore people be busy in bring various last thing on board
chapter_21	meanwhile captain ahab remain invisibly enshrine within -PRON- cabin
chapter_22	now mr. starbuck be -PRON- sure everything be right
chapter_22	well call all hand then
chapter_22	muster -PRON- aft here blast -PRON-
chapter_22	no need of profane word however great the hurry peleg say bildad but away with thee friend starbuck and do -PRON- bidding
chapter_22	how now
chapter_22	here upon the very point of start for the voyage captain peleg and captain bildad be go -PRON- with a high hand on the quarter deck just as if -PRON- be to be joint commander at sea as well as to all appearance in port
chapter_22	and as for captain ahab no sign of -PRON- be yet to be see only -PRON- say -PRON- be in the cabin
chapter_22	indeed as that be not at all -PRON- proper business but the pilot 's and as -PRON- be not yet completely recover so -PRON- say therefore captain ahab stay below
chapter_22	and all this seem natural enough especially as in the merchant service many captain never show -PRON- on deck for a considerable time after heave up the anchor but remain over the cabin table have a farewell merry making with -PRON- shore friend before -PRON- quit the ship for good with the pilot
chapter_22	but there be not much chance to think over the matter for captain peleg be now all alive
chapter_22	-PRON- seem to do most of the talking and commanding and not bildad
chapter_22	aft here ye son of bachelor -PRON- cry as the sailor linger at the main mast
chapter_22	"strike the tent there!""--wa the next order"
chapter_22	as -PRON- hint before this whalebone marquee be never pitch except in port and on board the pequod for thirty year the order to strike the tent be well known to be the next thing to heave up the anchor
chapter_22	man the capstan
chapter_22	"blood and thunder!--jump!""--wa the next command and the crew spring for the handspike"
chapter_22	now in get under weigh the station generally occupy by the pilot be the forward part of the ship
chapter_22	and here bildad who with peleg be -PRON- know in addition to -PRON- other officer be one of the licensed pilot of the port -PRON- be suspect to have get -PRON- make a pilot in order to save the nantucket pilot fee to all the ship -PRON- be concern in for -PRON- never pilot any other craft bildad -PRON- say may now be see actively engage in look over the bow for the approach anchor and at interval singing what seem a dismal stave of psalmody to cheer the hand at the windlass who roar forth some sort of a chorus about the girl in booble alley with hearty good will
chapter_22	meantime oversee the other part of the ship captain peleg rip and swear astern in the most frightful manner
chapter_22	-PRON- almost think -PRON- would sink the ship before the anchor could be get up involuntarily -PRON- pause on -PRON- handspike and tell queequeg to do the same think of the peril -PRON- both run in start on the voyage with such a devil for a pilot
chapter_22	-PRON- be comfort -PRON- however with the think that in pious bildad may be find some salvation spite of -PRON- seven hundred and seventy seventh lay when -PRON- feel a sudden sharp poke in -PRON- rear and turn round be horrify at the apparition of captain peleg in the act of withdraw -PRON- leg from -PRON- immediate vicinity
chapter_22	that be -PRON- first kick
chapter_22	be that the way -PRON- heave in the marchant service
chapter_22	-PRON- roar
chapter_22	spring thou sheep head spring and break thy backbone
chapter_22	why do not ye spring -PRON- say all of ye spring
chapter_22	spring thou chap with the red whisker spring there scotch cap spring thou green pant
chapter_22	spring -PRON- say all of ye and spring -PRON- eye out
chapter_22	and so say -PRON- move along the windlass here and there use -PRON- leg very freely while imperturbable bildad keep lead off with -PRON- psalmody
chapter_22	at last the anchor be up the sail be set and off -PRON- glide
chapter_22	-PRON- be a short cold christmas and as the short northern day merge into night -PRON- find -PRON- almost broad upon the wintry ocean whose freezing spray case -PRON- in ice as in polished armor
chapter_22	lank bildad as pilot head the first watch and ever and anon as the old craft deep dive into the green sea and send the shivering frost all over -PRON- and the wind howl and the cordage ring -PRON- steady note be heard,-- sweet field beyond the swell flood stand dress in live green
chapter_22	so to the jews old canaan stand while jordan roll between
chapter_22	never do those sweet word sound more sweetly to -PRON- than then
chapter_22	-PRON- be full of hope and fruition
chapter_22	the stout sail boat that have accompany -PRON- begin range alongside
chapter_22	-PRON- be curious and not unpleasing how peleg and bildad be affect at this juncture especially captain bildad
chapter_22	for loath to depart yet very loath to leave for good a ship bind on so long and perilous a voyage beyond both stormy capes a ship in which some thousand of -PRON- hard earn dollar be invest a ship in which an old shipmate sail as captain a man almost as old as -PRON- once more start to encounter all the terror of the pitiless jaw loath to say good bye to a thing so every way brimful of every interest to -PRON- poor old bildad linger long pace the deck with anxious stride run down into the cabin to speak another farewell word there again come on deck and look to windward look towards the wide and endless water only bound by the far off unseen eastern continents look towards the land look aloft look right and leave look everywhere and nowhere and at last mechanically coil a rope upon -PRON- pin convulsively grasp stout peleg by the hand and hold up a lantern for a moment stand gaze heroically in -PRON- face as much as to say nevertheless friend peleg -PRON- can stand -PRON- yes -PRON- can
chapter_22	and -PRON- too do not a little run from cabin to deck now a word below and now a word with starbuck the chief mate
chapter_22	"but at last -PRON- turn to -PRON- comrade with a final sort of look about him,--""captain bildad come old shipmate -PRON- must go"
chapter_22	back the main yard there
chapter_22	boat ahoy
chapter_22	stand by to come close alongside now
chapter_22	careful careful!--come bildad boy say -PRON- last
chapter_22	hurrah and away
chapter_22	god bless ye and have ye in -PRON- holy keeping man murmur old bildad almost incoherently
chapter_22	-PRON- hope ye'll have fine weather now so that captain ahab may soon be move among ye a pleasant sun be all -PRON- need and ye'll have plenty of -PRON- in the tropic voyage ye go
chapter_22	do not stave the boat needlessly ye harpooneer good white cedar plank be raise full three per cent within the year
chapter_22	do not forget -PRON- prayer either
chapter_22	mr. starbuck mind that cooper do not waste the spare stave
chapter_22	oh
chapter_22	do not whale -PRON- too much a lord 's day man but do not miss a fair chance either that be reject heaven 's good gift
chapter_22	be careful with the butter twenty cent the pound -PRON- be and mind ye
chapter_22	if-- come come
chapter_22	captain bildad stop palaver away
chapter_22	ship and boat diverge the cold damp night breeze blow between a scream gull fly overhead the two hull wildly roll -PRON- give three heavy hearted cheer and blindly plunge like fate into the lone atlantic
chapter_23	the lee shore
chapter_23	when on that shiver winter 's night the pequod thrust -PRON- vindictive bow into the cold malicious wave who should -PRON- see stand at -PRON- helm but bulkington
chapter_23	-PRON- look with sympathetic awe and fearfulness upon the man who in mid winter just land from a four year dangerous voyage could so unrestingly push off again for still another tempestuous term
chapter_23	the land seem scorch to -PRON- foot
chapter_23	wonderfull thing be ever the unmentionable deep memory yield no epitaph this six inch chapter be the stoneless grave of bulkington
chapter_23	let -PRON- only say that -PRON- fare with -PRON- as with the storm toss ship that miserably drive along the leeward land
chapter_23	all that be kind to -PRON- mortality
chapter_23	know ye now bulkington
chapter_23	glimpses do ye seem to see of that mortally intolerable truth that all deep earnest thinking be but the intrepid effort of the soul to keep the open independence of -PRON- sea while the wild wind of heaven and earth conspire to cast -PRON- on the treacherous slavish shore
chapter_23	but as in landlessness alone reside high truth shoreless indefinite as god so better be -PRON- to perish in that howl infinite than be ingloriously dash upon the lee even if that be safety
chapter_23	for worm like then oh who would craven crawl to land
chapter_23	terror of the terrible
chapter_23	take heart take heart o bulkington
chapter_23	bear thee grimly demigod
chapter_24	the advocate
chapter_24	as queequeg
chapter_24	and -PRON- be now fairly embark in this business of whaling and as this business of whaling have somehow come to be regard among landsman as a rather unpoetical and disreputable pursuit therefore -PRON- be all anxiety to convince ye ye landsman of the injustice hereby do to -PRON- hunter of whale
chapter_24	if a stranger be introduce into any miscellaneous metropolitan society -PRON- would but slightly advance the general opinion of -PRON- merit be -PRON- present to the company as a harpooneer say and if in emulation of the naval officer -PRON- should append the initial s.w.f. sperm whale fishery to -PRON- visit card such a procedure would be deem pre eminently presuming and ridiculous
chapter_24	doubtless one lead reason why the world decline honour -PRON- whaleman be this -PRON- think that at good -PRON- vocation amount to a butchering sort of business and that when actively engage therein -PRON- be surround by all manner of defilement
chapter_24	butcher -PRON- be that be true
chapter_24	and if the idea of peril so much enhance the popular conceit of the soldier 's profession let -PRON- assure ye that many a veteran who have freely march up to a battery would quickly recoil at the apparition of the sperm whale 's vast tail fan into eddy the air over -PRON- head
chapter_24	but look at this matter in other light weigh -PRON- in all sort of scale see what -PRON- whaleman be and have be
chapter_24	of france at -PRON- own personal expense fit out whale ship from dunkirk and politely invite to that town some score or two of family from -PRON- own island of nantucket
chapter_24	and lastly how come -PRON- that -PRON- whaleman of america now outnumber all the rest of the banded whalemen in the world sail a navy of upwards of seven hundred vessel manned by eighteen thousand man yearly consume 4,000,000 of dollar the ship worth at the time of sailing $ 20,000,000 and every year import into -PRON- harbor a well reap harvest of $ 7,000,000
chapter_24	how come all this if there be not something puissant in whaling
chapter_24	but this be not the half look again
chapter_24	one way and another -PRON- have beget event so remarkable in -PRON- and so continuously momentous in -PRON- sequential issue that whaling may well be regard as that egyptian mother who bear offspring -PRON- pregnant from -PRON- womb
chapter_24	let a handful suffice

chapter_25	postscript
chapter_25	in behalf of the dignity of whaling -PRON- would fain advance naught but substantiate fact
chapter_25	but after embattle -PRON- fact an advocate who should wholly suppress a not unreasonable surmise which may tell eloquently upon -PRON- cause such an advocate would -PRON- not be blameworthy
chapter_25	-PRON- be well known that at the coronation of king and queen even modern one a certain curious process of season -PRON- for -PRON- function be go through
chapter_25	there be a saltcellar of state so call and there may be a castor of state
chapter_25	how -PRON- use the salt precisely who know
chapter_25	certain -PRON- be however that a king 's head be solemnly oil at -PRON- coronation even as a head of salad
chapter_25	can -PRON- be though that -PRON- anoint -PRON- with a view of make -PRON- interior run well as -PRON- anoint machinery
chapter_25	much may be ruminate here concern the essential dignity of this regal process because in common life -PRON- esteem but meanly and contemptibly a fellow who anoint -PRON- hair and palpably smell of that anointing
chapter_25	in truth a mature man who use hair oil unless medicinally that man have probably get a quoggy spot in -PRON- somewhere
chapter_25	as a general rule -PRON- can not amount to much in -PRON- totality
chapter_25	certainly -PRON- can not be olive oil nor macassar oil nor castor oil nor bear 's oil nor train oil nor cod liver oil
chapter_25	what then can -PRON- possibly be but sperm oil in -PRON- unmanufactured unpolluted state the sweet of all oil
chapter_25	think of that ye loyal britons
chapter_26	knights and squires
chapter_26	the chief mate of the pequod be starbuck a native of nantucket and a quaker by descent
chapter_26	-PRON- be a long earnest man and though bear on an icy coast seem well adapt to endure hot latitude -PRON- flesh be hard as twice bake biscuit
chapter_26	-PRON- must have be bear in some time of general drought and famine or upon one of those fast day for which -PRON- state be famous
chapter_26	only some thirty arid summer have -PRON- see
chapter_26	those summer have dry up all -PRON- physical superfluousness
chapter_26	but this -PRON- thinness so to speak seem no more the token of waste anxiety and care than -PRON- seem the indication of any bodily blight
chapter_26	-PRON- be merely the condensation of the man
chapter_26	-PRON- be by no mean ill looking quite the contrary
chapter_26	yet for all -PRON- hardy sobriety and fortitude there be certain quality in -PRON- which at time affected and in some case seem well nigh to overbalance all the rest
chapter_26	uncommonly conscientious for a seaman and endue with a deep natural reverence the wild watery loneliness of -PRON- life do therefore strongly incline -PRON- to superstition but to that sort of superstition which in some organization seem rather to spring somehow from intelligence than from ignorance
chapter_26	outward portent and inward presentiment be -PRON-
chapter_26	-PRON- will have no man in -PRON- boat say starbuck who be not afraid of a whale
chapter_26	by this -PRON- seem to mean not only that the most reliable and useful courage be that which arise from the fair estimation of the encountered peril but that an utterly fearless man be a far more dangerous comrade than a coward
chapter_26	aye aye say stubb the second mate starbuck there be as careful a man as -PRON- will find anywhere in this fishery
chapter_26	but -PRON- shall ere long see what that word careful precisely mean when use by a man like stubb or almost any other whale hunter
chapter_26	starbuck be no crusader after peril in -PRON- courage be not a sentiment but a thing simply useful to -PRON- and always at hand upon all mortally practical occasion
chapter_26	besides -PRON- think perhaps that in this business of whaling courage be one of the great staple outfits of the ship like -PRON- beef and -PRON- bread and not to be foolishly waste
chapter_26	wherefore -PRON- have no fancy for lower for whale after sun down nor for persist in fight a fish that too much persist in fight -PRON-
chapter_26	for think starbuck -PRON- be here in this critical ocean to kill whale for -PRON- living and not to be kill by -PRON- for -PRON- and that hundred of man have be so kill starbuck well know
chapter_26	what doom be -PRON- own father 's
chapter_26	where in the bottomless deep could -PRON- find the tear limb of -PRON- brother
chapter_26	with memory like these in -PRON- and moreover give to a certain superstitiousness as have be say the courage of this starbuck which could nevertheless still flourish must indeed have be extreme
chapter_26	but -PRON- be not in reasonable nature that a man so organized and with such terrible experience and remembrance as -PRON- have -PRON- be not in nature that these thing should fail in latently engender an element in -PRON- which under suitable circumstance would break out from -PRON- confinement and burn all -PRON- courage up
chapter_26	and brave as -PRON- may be
chapter_26	-PRON- be that sort of bravery chiefly visible in some intrepid man which while generally abide firm in the conflict with sea or wind or whale or any of the ordinary irrational horror of the world yet can not withstand those more terrific because more spiritual terror which sometimes menace -PRON- from the concentrate brow of an enraged and mighty man
chapter_26	man may seem detestable as joint stock company and nation knave fool and murderer there may be man may have mean and meagre face but man in the ideal be so noble and so sparkling such a grand and glowing creature that over any ignominious blemish in -PRON- all -PRON- fellow should run to throw -PRON- costly robe
chapter_26	nor can piety -PRON- at such a shameful sight completely stifle -PRON- upbraiding against the permitting star
chapter_26	but this august dignity -PRON- treat of be not the dignity of king and robe but that abound dignity which have no robed investiture
chapter_26	thou shalt see -PRON- shin in the arm that wield a pick or drive a spike that democratic dignity which on all hand radiate without end from god -PRON-
chapter_26	if then to mean mariner and renegade and castaway -PRON- shall hereafter ascribe high quality though dark weave round -PRON- tragic grace if even the most mournful perchance the most abased among -PRON- all shall at time lift -PRON- to the exalted mount if -PRON- shall touch that workman 's arm with some ethereal light if -PRON- shall spread a rainbow over -PRON- disastrous set of sun then against all mortal critic bear -PRON- out in -PRON- thou just spirit of equality which hast spread one royal mantle of humanity over all -PRON- kind
chapter_26	thou who didst clothe with doubly hammer leaf of fine gold the stumped and paupered arm of old cervantes
chapter_27	knights and squires
chapter_27	stubb be the second mate
chapter_27	-PRON- be a native of cape cod and hence accord to local usage be call a cape cod man
chapter_27	a happy go lucky neither craven nor valiant take peril as -PRON- come with an indifferent air and while engage in the most imminent crisis of the chase toil away calm and collect as a journeyman joiner engage for the year
chapter_27	good humor easy and careless -PRON- preside over -PRON- whale boat as if the most deadly encounter be but a dinner and -PRON- crew all invite guest
chapter_27	-PRON- be as particular about the comfortable arrangement of -PRON- part of the boat as an old stage driver be about the snugness of -PRON- box
chapter_27	when close to the whale in the very death lock of the fight -PRON- handle -PRON- unpitying lance coolly and off handedly as a whistling tinker -PRON- hammer
chapter_27	-PRON- would hum over -PRON- old rigadig tune while flank and flank with the most exasperated monster
chapter_27	long usage have for this stubb convert the jaw of death into an easy chair
chapter_27	what -PRON- think of death -PRON- there be no telling
chapter_27	whether -PRON- ever think of -PRON- at all may be a question but if -PRON- ever do chance to cast -PRON- mind that way after a comfortable dinner no doubt like a good sailor -PRON- take -PRON- to be a sort of call of the watch to tumble aloft and bestir -PRON- there about something which -PRON- would find out when -PRON- obey the order and not sooner
chapter_27	what perhaps with other thing make stubb such an easy going unfearing man so cheerily trudge off with the burden of life in a world full of grave pedlar all bow to the ground with -PRON- pack what help to bring about that almost impious good humor of -PRON- that thing must have be -PRON- pipe
chapter_27	-PRON- would almost as soon have expect -PRON- to turn out of -PRON- bunk without -PRON- nose as without -PRON- pipe
chapter_27	-PRON- keep a whole row of pipe there ready load stick in a rack within easy reach of -PRON- hand and whenever -PRON- turn in -PRON- smoke -PRON- all out in succession light one from the other to the end of the chapter then load -PRON- again to be in readiness anew
chapter_27	-PRON- say this continual smoking must have be one because at least of -PRON- peculiar disposition for every one know that this earthly air whether ashore or afloat be terribly infect with the nameless misery of the numberless mortal who have die exhale -PRON- and as in time of the cholera some people go about with a camphorated handkerchief to -PRON- mouth so likewise against all mortal tribulation stubb 's tobacco smoke may have operate as a sort of disinfect agent
chapter_27	the third mate be flask a native of tisbury in martha 's vineyard
chapter_27	a short stout ruddy young fellow very pugnacious concern whale who somehow seem to think that the great leviathan have personally and hereditarily affronted -PRON- and therefore -PRON- be a sort of point of honour with -PRON- to destroy -PRON- whenever encounter
chapter_27	as a carpenter 's nail be divide into wrought nail and cut nail so mankind may be similarly divide
chapter_27	little flask be one of the wrought one make to clinch tight and last long
chapter_27	-PRON- call -PRON- king post on board of the pequod because in form -PRON- could be well liken to the short square timber know by that name in arctic whaler and which by the mean of many radiate side timber insert into -PRON- serve to brace the ship against the icy concussion of those batter sea
chapter_27	now these three mate starbuck stubb and flask be momentous man
chapter_27	-PRON-
chapter_27	-PRON- be who by universal prescription command three of the pequod 's boat as headsmen
chapter_27	in that grand order of battle in which captain ahab would probably marshal -PRON- force to descend on the whale these three headsman be as captain of company
chapter_27	or be armed with -PRON- long keen whaling spear -PRON- be as a pick trio of lancer even as the harpooneer be flinger of javelin
chapter_27	and since in this famous fishery each mate or headsman like a gothic knight of old be always accompany by -PRON- boat steerer or harpooneer who in certain conjuncture provide -PRON- with a fresh lance when the former one have be badly twist or elbow in the assault and moreover as there generally subsist between the two a close intimacy and friendliness -PRON- be therefore but meet that in this place -PRON- set down who the pequod 's harpooneer be and to what headsman each of -PRON- belong
chapter_27	first of all be queequeg whom starbuck the chief mate have select for -PRON- squire
chapter_27	but queequeg be already know
chapter_27	in the fishery -PRON- usually go by the generic name of gay headers
chapter_27	tashtego 's long lean sable hair -PRON- high cheek bone and black rounding eye for an indian oriental in -PRON- largeness but antarctic in -PRON- glitter expression all this sufficiently proclaim -PRON- an inheritor of the unvitiated blood of those proud warrior hunter who in quest of the great new england moose have scour bow in hand the aboriginal forest of the main
chapter_27	but no longer snuff in the trail of the wild beast of the woodland tashtego now hunt in the wake of the great whale of the sea the unerring harpoon of the son fitly replace the infallible arrow of the sire
chapter_27	tashtego be stubb the second mate 's squire
chapter_27	suspend from -PRON- ear be two golden hoop so large that the sailor call -PRON- ring bolt and would talk of secure the top sail halyard to -PRON-
chapter_27	and never have be anywhere in the world but in africa nantucket and the pagan harbor most frequent by whaleman and have now lead for many year the bold life of the fishery in the ship of owner uncommonly heedful of what manner of man -PRON- ship daggoo retain all -PRON- barbaric virtue and erect as a giraffe move about the deck in all the pomp of six foot five in -PRON- sock
chapter_27	curious to tell this imperial negro ahasuerus daggoo be the squire of little flask who look like a chess man beside -PRON-
chapter_27	as for the residue of the pequod 's company be -PRON- say that at the present day not one in two of the many thousand man before the mast employ in the american whale fishery be americans bear though pretty nearly all the officer be
chapter_27	herein -PRON- be the same with the american whale fishery as with the american army and military and merchant navy and the engineering force employ in the construction of the american canals and railroads
chapter_27	the same -PRON- say because in all these case the native american liberally provide the brain the rest of the world as generously supply the muscle
chapter_27	no small number of these whaling seaman belong to the azores where the outward bind nantucket whaler frequently touch to augment -PRON- crew from the hardy peasant of those rocky shore
chapter_27	in like manner the greenland whaler sail out of hull or london put in at the shetland islands to receive the full complement of -PRON- crew
chapter_27	upon the passage homeward -PRON- drop -PRON- there again
chapter_27	how -PRON- be there be no telling but islanders seem to make the good whaleman
chapter_27	-PRON- be nearly all islanders in the pequod isolatoes too -PRON- call such not acknowledge the common continent of man but each isolato live on a separate continent of -PRON- own
chapter_27	yet now federated along one keel what a set these isolatoes be
chapter_27	oh no
chapter_27	-PRON- go before
chapter_27	poor alabama boy
chapter_27	on the grim pequod 's forecastle ye shall ere long see -PRON- beat -PRON- tambourine prelusive of the eternal time when send for to the great quarter deck on high -PRON- be bid strike in with angel and beat -PRON- tambourine in glory call a coward here hail a hero there
chapter_28	for several day after leave nantucket nothing above hatch be see of captain ahab
chapter_28	the mate regularly relieve each other at the watch and for aught that could be see to the contrary -PRON- seem to be the only commander of the ship only -PRON- sometimes issue from the cabin with order so sudden and peremptory that after all -PRON- be plain
chapter_28	-PRON- but command vicariously
chapter_28	this be strangely heighten at time by the ragged elijah 's diabolical incoherence uninvitedly recur to -PRON- with a subtle energy -PRON- could not have before conceive of
chapter_28	but whatev -PRON- be of apprehensiveness or uneasiness to call -PRON- so which -PRON- feel yet whenever -PRON- come to look about -PRON- in the ship -PRON- seem against all warrantry to cherish such emotion
chapter_28	three good more likely sea officer and man each in -PRON- own different way could not readily be find and -PRON- be every one of -PRON- americans a nantucketer a vineyarder a cape man
chapter_28	-PRON- be one of those less lowering but still grey and gloomy enough morning of the transition when with a fair wind the ship be rush through the water with a vindictive sort of leap and melancholy rapidity that as -PRON- mount to the deck at the call of the forenoon watch so soon as -PRON- level -PRON- glance towards the taffrail forebode shiver run over -PRON-
chapter_28	reality outran apprehension captain ahab stand upon -PRON- quarter deck
chapter_28	there seem no sign of common bodily illness about -PRON- nor of the recovery from any
chapter_28	-PRON- look like a man cut away from the stake when the fire have overrunningly waste all the limb without consume -PRON- or take away one particle from -PRON- compact aged robustness
chapter_28	-PRON- whole high broad form seem make of solid bronze and shape in an unalterable mould like cellini 's cast perseus
chapter_28	threading -PRON- way out from among -PRON- grey hair and continue
chapter_28	till -PRON- disappear in -PRON- clothing -PRON- see a slender rod like mark lividly whitish
chapter_28	-PRON- resemble that perpendicular seam sometimes make in the straight lofty trunk of a great tree when the upper lightning tearingly dart down -PRON- and without wrench a single twig peel and groove out the bark from top to bottom ere run off into the soil leave the tree still greenly alive but brand
chapter_28	so powerfully do the whole grim aspect of ahab affect -PRON- and the livid brand which streak -PRON- that for the first few moment -PRON- hardly note that not a little of this overbearing grimness be owe to the barbaric white leg upon which -PRON- partly stand
chapter_28	aye -PRON- be dismast off japan say the old gay head indian once but like -PRON- dismast craft -PRON- ship another mast without come home for -PRON-
chapter_28	-PRON- have a quiver of -PRON-
chapter_28	
chapter_28	-PRON- be strike with the singular posture -PRON- maintain
chapter_28	upon each side of the pequod 's quarter deck and pretty close to the mizzen shroud there be an auger hole bore about half an inch or so into the plank
chapter_28	-PRON- bone leg steady in that hole one arm elevate and holding by a shroud captain ahab stand erect look straight out beyond the ship 's ever pitch prow
chapter_28	there be an infinity of firmest fortitude a determinate unsurrenderable wilfulness in the fixed and fearless forward dedication of that glance
chapter_28	not a word -PRON- speak nor do -PRON- officer say aught to -PRON- though by all -PRON- minute gesture and expression -PRON- plainly show the uneasy if not painful consciousness of be under a troubled master eye
chapter_28	ere long from -PRON- first visit in the air -PRON- withdraw into -PRON- cabin
chapter_28	as the sky grow less gloomy indeed begin to grow a little genial -PRON- become still less and less a recluse as if when the ship have sail from home nothing but the dead wintry bleakness of the sea have then keep -PRON- so secluded
chapter_28	but the pequod be only make a passage now not regularly cruise nearly all whaling preparatif need supervision the mate be fully competent to so that there be little or nothing out of -PRON- to employ or excite ahab now and thus chase away for that one interval the cloud that layer upon layer be pile upon -PRON- brow as ever all cloud choose the lofty peak to pile -PRON- upon
chapter_29	enter ahab to -PRON- stubb
chapter_29	the starred and stately night seem haughty dame in jewelled velvet nurse at home in lonely pride the memory of -PRON- absent conquer earls the golden helmeted sun
chapter_29	for sleep man twa hard to choose between such winsome day and such seduce night
chapter_29	and all these subtle agency more and more -PRON- work on ahab 's texture
chapter_29	old age be always wakeful as if the longer link with life the less man have to do with aught that look like death
chapter_29	among sea commander the old greybeard will oftenest leave -PRON- berth to visit the night cloak deck
chapter_29	-PRON- be so with ahab only that now of late -PRON- seem so much to live in the open air that truly speak -PRON- visit be more to the cabin than from the cabin to the plank
chapter_29	some consider touch of humanity be in -PRON- for at time like these -PRON- usually abstain from patrol the quarter deck because to -PRON- wearied mate seek repose within six inch of -PRON- ivory heel such would have be the reverberate crack and din of that bony step that -PRON- dream would have be on the crunch tooth of shark
chapter_29	but once the mood be on -PRON- too deep for common regarding and as with heavy lumber like pace -PRON- be measure the ship from taffrail to mainmast stubb the old second mate come up from below with a certain unassured deprecate humorousness hint that if captain ahab be pleased to walk the plank then no one could say nay but there may be some way of muffle the noise hint something indistinctly and hesitatingly about a globe of tow and the insertion into -PRON- of the ivory heel
chapter_29	stubb thou didst not know ahab then
chapter_29	be -PRON- a cannon ball stubb say ahab that thou wouldst wad -PRON- that fashion
chapter_29	but go thy way -PRON- have forget
chapter_29	below to thy nightly grave where such as ye sleep between shroud to use ye to the fill one at last
chapter_29	down dog and kennel
chapter_29	avast grit ahab between -PRON- set tooth and violently move away as if to avoid some passionate temptation
chapter_29	no sir not yet say stubb embolden -PRON- will not tamely be call a dog sir
chapter_29	then be call ten time a donkey and a mule and an ass and begone or -PRON- will clear the world of thee
chapter_29	as -PRON- say this ahab advance upon -PRON- with such overbearing terror in -PRON- aspect that stubb involuntarily retreat
chapter_29	-PRON- be never serve so before without give a hard blow for -PRON- mutter stubb as -PRON- find -PRON- descend the cabin scuttle
chapter_29	stop stubb somehow now -PRON- do not well know whether to go back and strike -PRON- or what be that
chapter_29	yes that be the thought come up in -PRON- but -PRON- would be the first time -PRON- ever do pray
chapter_29	how -PRON- flash at me!--his eye like powder pan
chapter_29	be -PRON- mad
chapter_29	anyway there be something on -PRON- mind as sure as there must be something on a deck when -PRON- crack
chapter_29	a hot old man
chapter_29	-PRON- 's full of riddle -PRON- wonder what -PRON- go into the after hold for every night as dough boy tell -PRON- -PRON- suspect what be that for -PRON- should like to know
chapter_29	who be make appointment with -PRON- in the hold
chapter_29	be not that queer now
chapter_29	but there be no telling -PRON- be the old game here go for a snooze
chapter_29	damn -PRON- -PRON- be worth a fellow 's while to be bear into the world if only to fall right asleep
chapter_29	and now that -PRON- think of -PRON- that be about the first thing baby do and that be a sort of queer too
chapter_29	damn -PRON- but all thing be queer come to think of -PRON-
chapter_29	but that be against -PRON- principle
chapter_29	so here go again
chapter_29	but how be that
chapter_29	do not -PRON- call -PRON- a dog
chapter_29	blaze
chapter_29	-PRON- call -PRON- ten time a donkey and pile a lot of jackass on top of that
chapter_29	-PRON- may as well have kick -PRON- and do with -PRON-
chapter_29	maybe -PRON- do kick -PRON- and -PRON- do not observe -PRON- -PRON- be so take all aback with -PRON- brow somehow
chapter_29	-PRON- flash like a bleached bone
chapter_29	what the devil 's the matter with -PRON-
chapter_29	come afoul of that old man have a sort of turn -PRON- wrong side out
chapter_29	by the lord -PRON- must have be dream though
chapter_29	how
chapter_29	how
chapter_29	but the only way 's to stash -PRON- so here go to hammock again and in the morning -PRON- will see how this plaguey juggling think over by daylight
chapter_30	the pipe
chapter_30	when stubb have depart ahab stand for a while lean over the bulwark and then as have be usual with -PRON- of late call a sailor of the watch -PRON- send -PRON- below for -PRON- ivory stool and also -PRON- pipe
chapter_30	in old norse time the throne of the sea love danish king be fabricate saith tradition of the tusk of the narwhale
chapter_30	how could one look at ahab then seat on that tripod of bone without bethink -PRON- of the royalty -PRON- symbolize
chapter_30	for a khan of the plank and a king of the sea and a great lord of leviathans be ahab
chapter_30	oh -PRON- pipe
chapter_30	hard must -PRON- go with -PRON- if thy charm be go
chapter_30	here have -PRON- be unconsciously toil not pleasur aye and ignorantly smoke to windward all the while to windward and with such nervous whiff as if like the die whale -PRON- final jet be the strong and full of trouble
chapter_30	what business have -PRON- with this pipe
chapter_30	the fire hiss in the wave the same instant the ship shoot by the bubble the sink pipe make
chapter_31	queen mab
chapter_31	such a queer dream king post -PRON- never have
chapter_31	-PRON- know the old man 's ivory leg well -PRON- dream -PRON- kick -PRON- with -PRON- and when -PRON- try to kick back upon -PRON- soul -PRON- little man -PRON- kick -PRON- leg right off
chapter_31	and then presto
chapter_31	ahab seem a pyramid and -PRON- like a blaze fool keep kick at -PRON-
chapter_31	but what be still more curious flask -PRON- know how curious all dream be through all this rage that -PRON- be in -PRON- somehow seem to be think to -PRON- that after all -PRON- be not much of an insult that kick from ahab
chapter_31	-PRON- be not a real leg only a false leg
chapter_31	and there be a mighty difference between a living thump and a dead thump
chapter_31	that be what make a blow from the hand flask fifty time more savage to bear than a blow from a cane
chapter_31	the live member that make the live insult -PRON- little man
chapter_31	and think -PRON- to -PRON- all the while mind while -PRON- be stub -PRON- silly toe against that curse pyramid so confoundedly contradictory be -PRON- all all the while -PRON- say -PRON- be thinking to -PRON- what be -PRON- leg now but a cane a whalebone cane
chapter_31	but now come the great joke of the dream flask
chapter_31	while -PRON- be batter away at the pyramid a sort of badger haired old merman with a hump on -PRON- back take -PRON- by the shoulder and slew -PRON- round
chapter_31	man but -PRON- be frightened
chapter_31	such a phiz
chapter_31	but somehow next moment -PRON- be over the fright
chapter_31	what be -PRON- about say -PRON- at last
chapter_31	and what business be that of -PRON- -PRON- should like to know mr. humpback
chapter_31	do you want a kick
chapter_31	says -PRON- on second thought -PRON- guess -PRON- will not kick -PRON- old fellow
chapter_31	wise stubb say -PRON- wise stubb and keep mutter -PRON- all the time a sort of eating of -PRON- own gum like a chimney hag
chapter_31	see -PRON- be not go to stop say over -PRON- wise stubb wise stubb -PRON- think -PRON- may as well fall to kick the pyramid again
chapter_31	what be the matter now old fellow
chapter_31	i--'right
chapter_31	very good say he--'he use -PRON- ivory leg do not -PRON-
chapter_31	yes -PRON- do say
chapter_31	do not -PRON- kick with right good will
chapter_31	-PRON- be not a common pitch pine leg -PRON- kick with be -PRON-
chapter_31	remember what -PRON- say be kick by -PRON- account -PRON- kick honour and on no account kick back for -PRON- can not help -PRON- wise stubb
chapter_31	with that -PRON- all of a sudden seem somehow in some queer fashion to swim off into the air
chapter_31	now what do -PRON- think of that dream flask
chapter_31	
chapter_31	may be may be
chapter_31	but -PRON- be make a wise man of -PRON- flask
chapter_31	d'ye see ahab stand there sideways look over the stern
chapter_31	halloa
chapter_31	what be that -PRON- shout
chapter_31	hark
chapter_31	mast head there
chapter_31	look sharp all of ye
chapter_31	if ye see a white one split -PRON- lung for -PRON-
chapter_31	what do -PRON- think of that now flask
chapter_31	be not there a small drop of
chapter_31	something queer about that eh
chapter_31	look ye
chapter_31	there be something special in the wind
chapter_31	stand by for -PRON- flask
chapter_31	ahab have that that be bloody on -PRON- mind
chapter_31	
chapter_32	cetology
chapter_32	already -PRON- be boldly launch upon the deep but soon -PRON- shall be lose in -PRON- unshored harbourless immensity
chapter_32	-PRON- be some systematized exhibition of the whale in -PRON- broad genera that -PRON- would now fain put before -PRON-
chapter_32	yet be -PRON- no easy task
chapter_32	listen to what the good and late authority have lay down
chapter_32	-PRON- be not -PRON- intention be -PRON- in -PRON- power to enter into the inquiry as to the true method of divide the cetacea into group and family
chapter_32	utter confusion exist among the historian of this animal sperm whale say surgeon beale a.d. 1839
chapter_32	a field strew with thorn
chapter_32	all these incomplete indication but serve to torture -PRON- naturalist
chapter_32	thus speak of the whale the great cuvier and john hunter and lesson those light of zoology and anatomy
chapter_32	nevertheless though of real knowledge there be little yet of book there be a plenty and so in some small degree with cetology or the science of whale
chapter_32	many be the man small and great old and new landsman and seaman who have at large or in little write of the whale
chapter_32	run over a few
chapter_32	the authors of the bible aristotle pliny aldrovandi sir thomas browne gesner ray linnaeus rondeletius willoughby green artedi sibbald brisson marten lacepede bonneterre desmarest baron cuvier frederick cuvier john hunter owen scoresby beale bennett j. ross browne the author of miriam coffin olmstead and the rev. t. cheever
chapter_32	but to what ultimate generalize purpose all these have write the above cite extract will show
chapter_32	of the name in this list of whale author only those follow owen ever see live whale and but one of -PRON- be a real professional harpooneer and whaleman
chapter_32	-PRON- mean captain scoresby
chapter_32	on the separate subject of the greenland or right whale -PRON- be the best exist authority
chapter_32	but scoresby know nothing and say nothing of the great sperm whale compare with which the greenland whale be almost unworthy mentioning
chapter_32	-PRON- be not even by any mean the large of the whale
chapter_32	yet owe to the long priority of -PRON- claim and the profound ignorance which till some seventy year back invest the then fabulous or utterly unknown sperm whale and which ignorance to this present day still reign in all but some few scientific retreat and whale port this usurpation have be every way complete
chapter_32	reference to nearly all the leviathanic allusion in the great poet of past day will satisfy -PRON- that the greenland whale without one rival be to -PRON- the monarch of the sea
chapter_32	but the time have at last come for a new proclamation
chapter_32	this be charing cross hear ye
chapter_32	good people all the greenland whale be depose the great sperm whale now reigneth
chapter_32	there be only two book in be which at all pretend to put the living sperm whale before -PRON- and at the same time in the remote degree succeed in the attempt
chapter_32	those book be beale 's and bennett 's both in -PRON- time surgeon to english south sea whale ship and both exact and reliable man
chapter_32	as yet however the sperm whale scientific or poetic live not complete in any literature
chapter_32	now the various specie of whale need some sort of popular comprehensive classification if only an easy outline one for the present hereafter to be fill in all -PRON- department by subsequent laborer
chapter_32	as no good man advance to take this matter in hand -PRON- offer -PRON- own poor endeavor
chapter_32	-PRON- promise nothing complete because any human thing suppose to be complete must for that very reason infallibly be faulty
chapter_32	-PRON- shall not pretend to a minute anatomical description of the various specie or in this place at least to much of any description
chapter_32	-PRON- be the architect not the builder
chapter_32	but -PRON- be a ponderous task no ordinary letter sorter in the post office be equal to -PRON-
chapter_32	to grope down into the bottom of the sea after -PRON- to have one 's hand among the unspeakable foundation rib and very pelvis of the world this be a fearful thing
chapter_32	what be
chapter_32	-PRON- that -PRON- should essay to hook the nose of this leviathan
chapter_32	the awful taunting in job may well appal -PRON-
chapter_32	but -PRON- have swim through library and sail through ocean -PRON- have have to do with whale with these visible hand -PRON- be in earnest and -PRON- will try
chapter_32	there be some preliminary to settle
chapter_32	in -PRON- system of nature a.d. 1776 linnaeus declare -PRON- hereby separate the whale from the fish
chapter_32	but of -PRON- own knowledge -PRON- know that down to the year 1850 shark and shad alewife and herring against linnaeus 's express edict be still find divide the possession of the same sea with the leviathan
chapter_32	the ground upon which linnaeus would fain have banish the whale from the water -PRON- state as follow on account of -PRON- warm bilocular heart -PRON- lung -PRON- movable eyelid -PRON- hollow ear penem intrantem feminam mammis lactantem and finally ex lege naturae jure meritoque
chapter_32	charley profanely hint -PRON- be humbug be -PRON- know that waive all argument -PRON- take the good old fashioned ground that the whale be a fish and call upon holy jonah to back -PRON-
chapter_32	this fundamental thing settle the next point be in what internal respect do the whale differ from other fish
chapter_32	but in brief -PRON- be these lung and warm blood whereas all other fish be lungless and cold blooded
chapter_32	there -PRON- have -PRON-
chapter_32	a walrus spout much like a whale but the walrus be not a fish because -PRON- be amphibious
chapter_32	almost any one must have notice that all the fish familiar to landsman have not a flat but a vertical or up and down tail
chapter_32	whereas among spout fish the tail though -PRON- may be similarly shape invariably assume a horizontal position
chapter_32	
chapter_32	hence all the small spout and horizontal tail fish must be include in this ground plan of cetology
chapter_32	now then come the grand division of the entire whale host
chapter_32	-PRON- be aware that down to the present time the fish style lamatins and dugongs pig fish and sow fish of the coffins of nantucket be include by many naturalist among the whale
chapter_32	but as these pig fish be a noisy contemptible set mostly lurk in the mouth of river and feed on wet hay and especially as -PRON- do not spout -PRON- deny -PRON- credential as whale and have present -PRON- with -PRON- passport to quit the kingdom of cetology
chapter_32	first accord to magnitude -PRON- divide the whale into three primary books subdivisible into chapters and these shall comprehend -PRON- all both small and large
chapter_32	i. the folio whale ii
chapter_32	the octavo whale iii
chapter_32	the duodecimo whale
chapter_32	as the type of the folio -PRON- present the sperm whale
chapter_32	of the octavo the grampus of the duodecimo the porpoise folios
chapter_32	among these -PRON- here include the follow chapter i. the sperm whale ii
chapter_32	the right whale iii
chapter_32	the fin back whale iv
chapter_32	the sulphur bottom whale book i. folio chapter i.
chapter_32	sperm whale).--this whale among the english of old vaguely know as the trumpa whale and the physeter whale and the anvil headed whale be the present cachalot of the french and the pottsfich of the germans and the macrocephalus of the long words
chapter_32	-PRON- be without doubt the large inhabitant of the globe the most formidable of all whale to encounter the most majestic in aspect and lastly by far the most valuable in commerce -PRON- be the only creature from which that valuable substance spermaceti be obtain
chapter_32	all -PRON- peculiarity will in many other place be enlarge upon
chapter_32	philologically consider -PRON- be absurd
chapter_32	in those time also spermaceti be exceedingly scarce not be use for light but only as an ointment and medicament
chapter_32	-PRON- be only to be have from the druggist as -PRON- nowadays buy an ounce of rhubarb
chapter_32	when as -PRON- opine in the course of time the true nature of spermaceti become know -PRON- original name be still retain by the dealer no doubt to enhance -PRON- value by a notion so strangely significant of -PRON- scarcity
chapter_32	and so the appellation must at last have come to be bestow upon the whale from which this spermaceti be really derive
chapter_32	book i. folio chapter ii
chapter_32	
chapter_32	among the fisherman -PRON- be indiscriminately designate by all the following title
chapter_32	the whale the greenland whale the black whale the great whale the true whale the right whale
chapter_32	there be a deal of obscurity concern the identity of the specie thus multitudinously baptise
chapter_32	-PRON- be the great mysticetus of the english naturalist the greenland whale of the english whalemen the baliene ordinaire of the french whaleman the growlands walfish of the swedes
chapter_32	right whale cruising grounds
chapter_32	some pretend to see a difference between the greenland whale of the english and the right whale of the americans
chapter_32	but -PRON- precisely agree in all -PRON- grand feature nor have there yet be present a single determinate fact upon which to ground a radical distinction
chapter_32	-PRON- be by endless subdivision base upon the most inconclusive difference that some department of natural history become so repellingly intricate
chapter_32	book i. folio chapter iii
chapter_32	fin back).--under this head
chapter_32	-PRON- reckon a monster which by the various name of fin back tall spout and long john have be see almost in every sea and be commonly the whale whose distant jet be so often descry by passenger cross the atlantic in the new york packet track
chapter_32	in the length -PRON- attain and in -PRON- baleen the fin back resemble the right whale but be of a less portly girth and a light colour approach to olive
chapter_32	-PRON- great lip present a cable like aspect form by the intertwisting slant fold of large wrinkle
chapter_32	-PRON- grand distinguish feature the fin from which -PRON- derive -PRON- name be often a conspicuous object
chapter_32	even if not the slight other part of the creature be visible this isolated fin will at time be see plainly project from the surface
chapter_32	when the sea be moderately calm and slightly mark with spherical ripple and this gnomon like fin stand up and cast shadow upon the wrinkled surface -PRON- may well be suppose that the watery circle surround -PRON- somewhat resemble a dial with -PRON- style and wavy hour line grave on -PRON-
chapter_32	on that ahaz dial the shadow often go back
chapter_32	the fin back be not gregarious
chapter_32	very shy always go solitary unexpectedly rise to the surface in the remote and most sullen water -PRON- straight and single lofty jet rise like a tall misanthropic spear upon a barren plain gifted with such wondrous power and velocity in swimming as to defy all present pursuit from man this leviathan seem the banish and unconquerable cain of -PRON- race bear for -PRON- mark that style upon -PRON- back
chapter_32	of these so call whalebone whale there would seem to be several variety most of which however be little known
chapter_32	broad nosed whale and beaked whale pike head whale bunch whale under jawed whale and rostrated whale be the fisherman 's name for a few sort
chapter_32	how then
chapter_32	the baleen hump back fin and tooth these be thing whose peculiarity be indiscriminately disperse among all sort of whale without any regard to what may be the nature of -PRON- structure in other and more essential particular
chapter_32	thus the sperm whale and the humpbacked whale each have a hump but there the similitude cease
chapter_32	then this same humpbacked whale and the greenland whale each of these have baleen but there again the similitude cease
chapter_32	and -PRON- be just the same with the other part above mention
chapter_32	on this rock every one of the whale naturalist have split
chapter_32	but -PRON- may possibly be conceive that in the internal part of the whale in -PRON- anatomy there at least -PRON- shall be able to hit the right classification
chapter_32	nay what thing for example be there in the greenland whale 's anatomy more striking than -PRON- baleen
chapter_32	and if -PRON- descend into the bowel of the various leviathan why there -PRON- will not find distinction a fiftieth part as available to the systematizer as those external one already enumerate
chapter_32	nothing but to take hold of the whale bodily in -PRON- entire liberal volume and boldly sort -PRON- that way
chapter_32	and this be the bibliographical system here adopt and -PRON- be the only one that can possibly succeed for -PRON- alone be practicable
chapter_32	hump
chapter_32	back).--this whale be often see on the northern american coast
chapter_32	-PRON- have be frequently capture there and tow into harbor
chapter_32	-PRON- have a great pack on -PRON- like a peddler or -PRON- may call -PRON- the elephant and castle whale
chapter_32	at any rate the popular name for -PRON- do not sufficiently distinguish -PRON- since the sperm whale also have a hump though a small one
chapter_32	-PRON- oil be not very valuable
chapter_32	book i. folio
chapter_32	though no coward -PRON- have never yet show any part of -PRON- but -PRON- back which rise in a long sharp ridge
chapter_32	let -PRON- go
chapter_32	-PRON- know little more of -PRON- nor do anybody else
chapter_32	book i. folio chapter vi
chapter_32	sulphur bottom).--another retire gentleman with a brimstone belly doubtless get by scrap along the tartarian tile in some of -PRON- profounder diving
chapter_32	-PRON- be seldom see at least -PRON- have never see -PRON- except in the remote southern sea and then always at too great a distance to study -PRON- countenance
chapter_32	-PRON- be never chase -PRON- would run away with rope walk of line
chapter_32	octavo
chapter_32	octavoes.*--these embrace the whale of middling magnitude among which present may be number i. the grampus ii
chapter_32	the black fish iii
chapter_32	why this book of whale be not denominate the quarto be very plain
chapter_32	because while the whale of this order though small than those of the former order nevertheless retain a proportionate likeness to -PRON- in figure yet the bookbinder 's quarto volume in -PRON- dimensioned form do not preserve the shape of the folio volume but the octavo volume do
chapter_32	book ii
chapter_32	grampus).--though this fish whose loud sonorous breathing or rather blow have furnish a proverb to landsman be so well know a denizen of the deep yet be -PRON- not popularly class among whale
chapter_32	but possess all the grand distinctive feature of the leviathan most naturalist have recognise -PRON- for one
chapter_32	by some fisherman -PRON- approach be regard as premonitory of the advance of the great sperm whale
chapter_32	book ii
chapter_32	octavo chapter ii
chapter_32	where any name happen to be vague or inexpressive -PRON- shall say so and suggest another
chapter_32	-PRON- do so now touch the black fish so call because blackness be the rule among almost all whale
chapter_32	so call -PRON- the hyena whale if -PRON- please
chapter_32	-PRON- be find in almost all latitude
chapter_32	-PRON- have a peculiar way of show -PRON- dorsal hooked fin in swimming which look something like a roman nose
chapter_32	though -PRON- blubber be very thin some of these whale will yield -PRON- upwards of thirty gallon of oil
chapter_32	book ii
chapter_32	octavo chapter iii
chapter_32	strictly speak this horn be but a lengthened tusk grow out from the jaw in a line a little depressed from the horizontal
chapter_32	but -PRON- be only find on the sinister side which have an ill effect give -PRON- owner something analogous to the aspect of a clumsy left handed man
chapter_32	what precise purpose this ivory horn or lance answer -PRON- would be hard to say
chapter_32	-PRON- do not seem to be use like the blade of the sword fish and bill fish though some sailor tell -PRON- that the narwhale employ -PRON- for a rake in turn over the bottom of the sea for food
chapter_32	charley coffin say -PRON- be use for an ice piercer for the narwhale rise to the surface of the polar sea and find -PRON- sheet with ice thrust -PRON- horn up and so break through
chapter_32	-PRON- own opinion be that however this one sided horn may really be use by the narwhale however that may be -PRON- would certainly be very convenient to -PRON- for a folder in read pamphlet
chapter_32	the narwhale -PRON- have hear call the tusked whale the horned whale and the unicorn whale
chapter_32	-PRON- be certainly a curious example of the unicornism to be find in almost every kingdom of animated nature
chapter_32	from certain cloistered old author -PRON- have gather that this same sea unicorn 's horn be in ancient day regard as the great antidote against poison and as such preparation of -PRON- bring immense price
chapter_32	originally -PRON- be in -PRON- account an object of great curiosity
chapter_32	black letter tell -PRON- that sir martin frobisher on -PRON- return from that voyage when queen bess do gallantly wave -PRON- jewelled hand to -PRON- from a window of greenwich palace as -PRON- bold ship sail down the thames when sir martin return from that voyage saith black letter on bended knee -PRON- present to -PRON- highness a prodigious long horn of the narwhale which for a long period after hang in the castle at windsor
chapter_32	an irish author aver that the earl of leicester on bended knee do likewise present to -PRON- highness another horn pertain to a land beast of the unicorn nature
chapter_32	the narwhale have a very picturesque leopard like look be of a milk white ground colour dot with round and oblong spot of black
chapter_32	-PRON- be mostly find in the circumpolar sea
chapter_32	octavo chapter iv
chapter_32	killer).--of this whale little be precisely know to the nantucketer and nothing at all to the profess naturalist
chapter_32	from what -PRON- have see of -PRON- at a distance -PRON- should say that -PRON- be about the bigness of a grampus
chapter_32	-PRON- be very savage a sort of feegee fish
chapter_32	the killer be never hunt
chapter_32	-PRON- never hear what sort of oil -PRON- have
chapter_32	exception may be take to the name bestow upon this whale on the ground of -PRON- indistinctness
chapter_32	for -PRON- be all killer on land and on sea bonaparte and sharks include
chapter_32	octavo chapter v.
chapter_32	thrasher).--this gentleman be famous for -PRON- tail which -PRON- use for a ferule in thrash -PRON- foe
chapter_32	still less be know of the thrasher than of the killer
chapter_32	thus end book ii
chapter_32	duodecimoes
chapter_32	these include the small whale
chapter_32	i.
chapter_32	ii
chapter_32	the mealy mouthed porpoise
chapter_32	to those who have not chance specially to study the subject -PRON- may possibly seem strange that fish not commonly exceed four or five foot should be marshal among whale a word which in the popular sense always convey an idea of hugeness
chapter_32	a spout fish with a horizontal tail book iii
chapter_32	duodecimo
chapter_33	the specksynder concern the officer of the whale craft
chapter_33	this seem as good a place as any to set down a little domestic peculiarity on ship board arise from the existence of the harpooneer class of officer a class unknown of course in any other marine than the whale fleet
chapter_33	the large importance attach to the harpooneer 's vocation be evince by the fact that originally in the old dutch fishery two century and more ago the command of a whale ship be not wholly lodge in the person now call the captain but be divide between -PRON- and an officer call the specksynder
chapter_33	literally this word mean fat cutter usage however in time make -PRON- equivalent to chief harpooneer
chapter_33	in those day the captain 's authority be restrict to the navigation and general management of the vessel while over the whale hunt department and all -PRON- concern the specksynder or chief harpooneer reign supreme
chapter_33	in the british greenland fishery under the corrupted title of specksioneer this old dutch official be still retain but -PRON- former dignity be sadly abridge
chapter_33	nevertheless as upon the good conduct of the harpooneer the success of a whaling voyage largely depend and since in the american fishery -PRON- be not only an important officer in the boat but under certain circumstance night watch on a whaling ground the command of the ship 's deck be also -PRON- therefore the grand political maxim of the sea demand that -PRON- should nominally live apart from the man before the mast and be in some way distinguished as -PRON- professional superior though always by -PRON- familiarly regard as -PRON- social equal
chapter_33	now the grand distinction draw between officer and man at sea be this the first life aft the last forward
chapter_33	hence in whale ship and merchantman alike the mate have -PRON- quarter with the captain and so too in most of the american whaler the harpooneer be lodge in the after part of the ship
chapter_33	indeed many be the nantucket ship in which -PRON- will see the skipper parade -PRON- quarter deck with an elated grandeur not surpass in any military navy nay extort almost as much outward homage as if -PRON- wear the imperial purple and not the shabby of pilot cloth
chapter_33	nor perhaps will -PRON- fail to be eventually perceive that behind those form and usage as -PRON- be -PRON- sometimes mask -PRON- incidentally make use of -PRON- for other and more private end than -PRON- be legitimately intend to subserve
chapter_33	that certain sultanism of -PRON- brain which have otherwise in a good degree remain unmanifested through those form that same sultanism become incarnate in an irresistible dictatorship
chapter_33	this -PRON- be that for ever keep god 's true prince of the empire from the world 's hustings and leave the high honour that this air can give to those man who become famous more through -PRON- infinite inferiority to the choice hide handful of the divine inert than through -PRON- undoubted superiority over the dead level of the mass
chapter_33	such large virtue lurk in these small thing when extreme political superstition invest -PRON- that in some royal instance even to idiot imbecility -PRON- have impart potency
chapter_33	but when as in the case of nicholas the czar the ringed crown of geographical empire encircle an imperial brain then the plebeian herd crouch abase before the tremendous centralization
chapter_33	nor will the tragic dramatist who would depict mortal indomitableness in -PRON- full sweep and direct swing ever forget a hint incidentally so important in -PRON- art as the one now allude to
chapter_33	but ahab -PRON- captain still move before -PRON- in all -PRON- nantucket grimness and shagginess and in this episode touch emperors and king -PRON- must not conceal that -PRON- have only to do with a poor old whale hunter like -PRON- and therefore all outward majestical trapping and housing be deny -PRON-
chapter_33	oh ahab
chapter_33	what shall be grand in thee -PRON- must needs be pluck at from the sky and dive for in the deep and feature in the unbodied air
chapter_34	-PRON- be noon and dough boy the steward thrust -PRON- pale loaf of bread face from the cabin scuttle announce dinner to -PRON- lord and master who sit in the lee quarter boat have just be take an observation of the sun and be now mutely reckon the latitude on the smooth medallion shape tablet reserve for that daily purpose on the upper part of -PRON- ivory leg
chapter_34	from -PRON- complete inattention to the tiding -PRON- would think that moody ahab have not hear -PRON- menial
chapter_34	but presently catch hold of the mizen shroud -PRON- swing -PRON- to the deck and in an even unexhilarated voice say dinner mr. starbuck disappear into the cabin
chapter_34	the second emir lounge about the rigging awhile and then slightly shake the main brace to see whether -PRON- will be all right with that important rope -PRON- likewise take up the old burden and with a rapid dinner mr. flask follow after -PRON- predecessor
chapter_34	but ere step into the cabin doorway below -PRON- pause ship a new face altogether and then independent hilarious little flask enter king ahab 's presence in the character of abjectus or the slave
chapter_34	-PRON- be not the least among the strange thing breed by the intense artificialness of sea usage that while in the open air of the deck some officer will upon provocation bear -PRON- boldly and defyingly enough towards -PRON- commander yet ten to one let those very officer the next moment go down to -PRON- customary dinner in that same commander 's cabin and straightway -PRON- inoffensive not to say deprecatory and humble air towards -PRON- as -PRON- sit at the head of the table this be marvellous sometimes most comical
chapter_34	wherefore this difference
chapter_34	a problem
chapter_34	to have be belshazzar king of babylon and to have be belshazzar not haughtily but courteously therein certainly must have be some touch of mundane grandeur
chapter_34	who have but once din -PRON- friend have taste what -PRON- be to be caesar
chapter_34	-PRON- be a witchery of social czarship which there be no withstanding
chapter_34	now if to this consideration -PRON- superadd the official supremacy of a ship master then by inference -PRON- will derive the because of that peculiarity of sea life just mention
chapter_34	over -PRON- ivory inlaid table ahab preside like a mute maned sea lion on the white coral beach surround by -PRON- warlike but still deferential cub
chapter_34	in -PRON- own proper turn each officer wait to be serve
chapter_34	-PRON- do not suppose that for the world -PRON- would have profane that moment with the slight observation even upon so neutral a topic as the weather
chapter_34	no
chapter_34	what a relief -PRON- be to choke stubb when a rat make a sudden racket in the hold below
chapter_34	for flask to have presume to help -PRON- this must have seem to -PRON- tantamount to larceny in the first degree
chapter_34	have -PRON- help -PRON- at that table doubtless never more would -PRON- have be able to hold -PRON- head up in this honest world nevertheless strange to say ahab never forbid -PRON-
chapter_34	and have flask help -PRON- the chance be ahab have never so much as noticed -PRON-
chapter_34	least of all do flask presume to help -PRON- to butter
chapter_34	another thing
chapter_34	flask be the last person down at the dinner and flask be the first man up
chapter_34	consider
chapter_34	for hereby flask 's dinner be badly jammed in point of time
chapter_34	therefore -PRON- be that flask once admit in private that ever since -PRON- have arise to the dignity of an officer from that moment -PRON- have never know what -PRON- be to be otherwise than hungry more or less
chapter_34	for what -PRON- eat do not so much relieve -PRON- hunger as keep -PRON- immortal in -PRON-
chapter_34	peace and satisfaction think flask have for ever depart from -PRON- stomach
chapter_34	-PRON- be an officer
chapter_34	but how -PRON- wish -PRON- could fish a bit of old fashioned beef in the forecastle as -PRON- use to when -PRON- be before the mast
chapter_34	there be the fruit of promotion now there be the vanity of glory there be the insanity of life
chapter_34	now ahab and -PRON- three mate form what may be call the first table in the pequod 's cabin
chapter_34	after -PRON- departure take place in inverted order to -PRON- arrival the canvas cloth be clear or rather be restore to some hurried order by the pallid steward
chapter_34	and then the three harpooneer be bid to the feast -PRON- be -PRON- residuary legatee
chapter_34	-PRON- make a sort of temporary servant hall of the high and mighty cabin
chapter_34	in strange contrast to the hardly tolerable constraint and nameless invisible domineering of the captain 's table be the entire care free license and ease the almost frantic democracy of those inferior fellow the harpooneer
chapter_34	while -PRON- master the mate seem afraid of the sound of the hinge of -PRON- own jaw the harpooneer chew -PRON- food with such a relish that there be a report to -PRON-
chapter_34	such portentous appetite have queequeg and tashtego that to fill out the vacancy make by the previous repast often the pale dough boy be fain to bring on a great baron of salt junk seemingly quarry out of the solid ox
chapter_34	and if -PRON- be not lively about -PRON- if -PRON- do not go with a nimble hop skip and jump then tashtego have an ungentlemanly way of accelerate -PRON- by dart a fork at -PRON- back harpoon wise
chapter_34	and once daggoo seize with a sudden humor assist dough boy 's memory by snatch -PRON- up bodily and thrust -PRON- head into a great empty wooden trencher while tashtego knife in hand begin lay out the circle preliminary to scalp -PRON-
chapter_34	-PRON- be naturally a very nervous shudder sort of little fellow this bread face steward the progeny of a bankrupt baker and a hospital nurse
chapter_34	and what with the standing spectacle of the black terrific ahab and the periodical tumultuous visitation of these three savage dough boy 's whole life be one continual lip quiver
chapter_34	commonly after see the harpooneer furnished with all thing -PRON- demand -PRON- would escape from -PRON- clutch into -PRON- little pantry adjoin and fearfully peep out at -PRON- through the blind of -PRON- door till all be over
chapter_34	-PRON- be a sight to see queequeg seat over against tashtego oppose -PRON- file tooth to the indian 's crosswise to -PRON- daggoo seat on the floor for a bench would have bring -PRON- hearse plumed head to the low carline at every motion of -PRON- colossal limb make the low cabin framework to shake as when an african elephant go passenger in a ship
chapter_34	but doubtless this noble savage feed strong and drink deep of the abounding element of air and through -PRON- dilated nostril snuff in the sublime life of the world
chapter_34	not by beef or by bread be giant make or nourish
chapter_34	but queequeg -PRON- have a mortal barbaric smack of the lip in eat an ugly sound enough so much so that the tremble dough boy almost look to see whether any mark of tooth lurk in -PRON- own lean arm
chapter_34	nor do the whetstone which the harpooneer carry in -PRON- pocket for -PRON- lance and other weapon and with which whetstone at dinner -PRON- would ostentatiously sharpen -PRON- knife that grate sound do not at all tend to tranquillize poor dough boy
chapter_34	how could -PRON- forget that in -PRON- island day queequeg for one must certainly have be guilty of some murderous convivial indiscretion
chapter_34	dough boy hard fare the white waiter who wait upon cannibal
chapter_34	not a napkin should -PRON- carry on -PRON- arm but a buckler
chapter_34	for when -PRON- do enter -PRON- -PRON- be something as a street door enter a house turn inwards for a moment only to be turn out the next and as a permanent thing reside in the open air
chapter_34	nor do -PRON- lose much hereby in the cabin be no companionship socially ahab be inaccessible
chapter_34	though nominally include in the census of christendom -PRON- be still an alien to -PRON-
chapter_34	-PRON- live in the world as the last of the grisly bears live in settle missouri
chapter_34	and as when spring and summer have depart that wild logan of the wood bury -PRON- in the hollow of a tree live out the winter there suck -PRON- own paw so in -PRON- inclement howl old age ahab 's soul shut up in the cave trunk of -PRON- body there feed upon the sullen paw of -PRON- gloom
chapter_35	-PRON- be during the more pleasant weather that in due rotation with the other seaman -PRON- first mast head come round
chapter_35	in most american whaleman the mast head be man almost simultaneously with the vessel be leave -PRON- port even though -PRON- may have fifteen thousand mile and more to sail ere reach -PRON- proper cruising ground
chapter_35	and if after a three four or five year voyage -PRON- be draw nigh home with anything empty in -PRON- say an empty vial even then -PRON- mast head be keep man to the last and not till -PRON- skysail pole sail in among the spire of the port do -PRON- altogether relinquish the hope of capture one whale more
chapter_35	now as the business of stand mast head ashore or afloat be a very ancient and interesting one let -PRON- in some measure expatiate here
chapter_35	-PRON- take -PRON- that the early stander of mast head be the old egyptians because in all -PRON- research -PRON- find none prior to -PRON-
chapter_35	for though -PRON- progenitor the builder of babel must doubtless by -PRON- tower have intend to rear the lofty mast head in all asia or africa either yet ere the final truck be put to -PRON- as that great stone mast of -PRON- may be say to have go by the board in the dread gale of god 's wrath therefore -PRON- can not give these babel builder priority over the egyptians
chapter_35	and that the egyptians be a nation of mast head stander be an assertion base upon the general belief among archaeologist that the first pyramid be found for astronomical purpose a theory singularly support by the peculiar stair like formation of all four side of those edifice whereby with prodigious long uplifting of -PRON- leg those old astronomer be will not to mount to the apex and sing out for new star even as the look out of a modern ship sing out for a sail or a whale just bear in sight
chapter_35	in saint stylites the famous christian hermit of old time who build -PRON- a lofty stone pillar in the desert and spend the whole latter portion of -PRON- life on -PRON- summit hoist -PRON- food from the ground with a tackle in -PRON- -PRON- have a remarkable instance of a dauntless stander of mast head who be not to be drive from -PRON- place by fog or frost rain hail or sleet but valiantly face everything out to the last literally die at -PRON- post
chapter_35	of modern stander of mast head -PRON- have but a lifeless set mere stone iron and bronze man who though well capable of face out a stiff gale be still entirely incompetent to the business of sing out upon discover any strange sight
chapter_35	there be napoleon who upon the top of the column of vendome stand with arm fold some one hundred and fifty foot in the air careless now who rule the deck below whether louis philippe louis blanc or louis the devil
chapter_35	admiral nelson also on a capstan of gun metal stand -PRON- mast head in trafalgar square and ever when most obscure by that london smoke token be yet give that a hide hero be there for where there be smoke must be fire
chapter_35	but neither great washington nor napoleon nor nelson will answer a single hail from below however madly invoke to befriend by -PRON- counsel the distracted deck upon which -PRON- gaze however -PRON- may be surmise that -PRON- spirit penetrate through the thick haze of the future and descry what shoal and what rock must be shun
chapter_35	-PRON- may seem unwarrantable to couple in any respect the mast head stander of the land with those of the sea but that in truth -PRON- be not so be plainly evince by an item for which obed macy the sole historian of nantucket stand accountable
chapter_35	the worthy obed tell -PRON- that in the early time of the whale fishery ere ship be regularly launch in pursuit of the game the people of that island erect lofty spar along the sea coast to which the look out ascend by mean of nail cleat something as fowl go upstairs in a hen house
chapter_35	a few year ago this same plan be adopt by the bay whaleman of new zealand who upon descry the game give notice to the ready man boat nigh the beach
chapter_35	but this custom have now become obsolete turn -PRON- then to the one proper mast head that of a whale ship at sea
chapter_35	there -PRON- stand a hundred foot above the silent deck stride along the deep as if the mast be gigantic stilt while beneath -PRON- and between -PRON- leg as -PRON- be swim the huge monster of the sea even as ship once sail between the boot of the famous colossus at old rhodes
chapter_35	there -PRON- stand lose in the infinite series of the sea with nothing ruffle but the wave
chapter_35	the tranced ship indolently roll the drowsy trade wind blow everything resolve -PRON- into languor
chapter_35	in one of those southern whalesman on a long three or four year voyage as often happen the sum of the various hour -PRON- spend at the mast head would amount to several entire month
chapter_35	and -PRON- be much to be deplore that the place to which -PRON- devote so considerable a portion of the whole term of -PRON- natural life should be so sadly destitute of anything approach to a cosy inhabitiveness or adapt to breed a comfortable localness of feeling such as pertain to a bed a hammock a hearse a sentry box a pulpit a coach or any other of those small and snug contrivance in which man temporarily isolate -PRON-
chapter_35	-PRON- most usual point of perch be the head of the t gallant mast where -PRON- stand upon two thin parallel stick almost peculiar to whaleman call the t gallant cross tree
chapter_35	here toss about by the sea the beginner feel about as cosy as -PRON- would stand on a bull 's horn
chapter_35	to be sure in cold weather -PRON- may carry -PRON- house aloft with -PRON- in the shape of a watch coat but properly speak the thick watch coat be no more of a house than the unclad body for as the soul be glue inside of -PRON- fleshy tabernacle and can not freely move about in -PRON- nor even move out of -PRON- without run great risk of perish like an ignorant pilgrim cross the snowy alps in winter so a watch coat be not so much of a house as -PRON- be a mere envelope or additional skin encase -PRON-
chapter_35	-PRON- can not put a shelf or chest of drawer in -PRON- body and no more can -PRON- make a convenient closet of -PRON- watch coat
chapter_35	concern all this -PRON- be much to be deplore that the mast head of a southern whale ship be unprovided with those enviable little tent or pulpit call crow's nests in which the look out of a greenland whaler be protect from the inclement weather of the frozen sea
chapter_35	in the fireside narrative of captain sleet entitled a voyage among the icebergs in quest of the greenland whale and incidentally for the re discovery of the lost icelandic colonies of old greenland in this admirable volume all stander of mast head be furnish with a charmingly circumstantial account of the then recently invent crow's nest of the glacier which be the name of captain sleet 's good craft
chapter_35	in shape the sleet 's crow's nest be something like a large tierce or pipe -PRON- be open above however where -PRON- be furnish with a movable side screen to keep to windward of -PRON- head in a hard gale
chapter_35	be fix on the summit of the mast -PRON- ascend into -PRON- through a little trap hatch in the bottom
chapter_35	in front be a leather rack in which to keep -PRON- speaking trumpet pipe telescope and other nautical convenience
chapter_35	when captain sleet in person stand -PRON- mast head in this crow's nest of -PRON- -PRON- tell -PRON- that -PRON- always have a rifle with -PRON- also fix in the rack together with a powder flask and shot for the purpose of pop off the stray narwhale or vagrant sea unicorn infest those water for -PRON- can not successfully shoot at -PRON- from the deck owe to the resistance of the water but to shoot down upon -PRON- be a very different thing
chapter_35	now -PRON- be plainly a labor of love for captain sleet to describe as -PRON- do all the little detailed convenience of -PRON- crow' nest but though -PRON- so enlarge upon many of these and though -PRON- treat -PRON- to a very scientific account of -PRON- experiment in this crow's nest with a small compass -PRON- keep there for the purpose of counteract the error result from what be call the local attraction of all binnacle magnet an error ascribable to the horizontal vicinity of the iron in the ship 's plank and in the glacier 's case perhaps to there have be so many break down blacksmith among -PRON- crew -PRON- say that though the captain be very discreet and scientific here yet for all -PRON- learn binnacle deviation azimuth compass observation and approximate error -PRON- know very well captain sleet that -PRON- be not so much immerse in those profound magnetic meditation as to fail be attract occasionally towards that well replenish little case bottle so nicely tuck in on one side of -PRON- crow 's nest within easy reach of -PRON- hand
chapter_35	though upon the whole -PRON- greatly admire and even love the brave the honest and learn captain yet -PRON- take -PRON- very ill of -PRON- that -PRON- should so utterly ignore that case bottle see what a faithful friend and comforter -PRON- must have be while with mittened finger and hooded head -PRON- be study the mathematic aloft there in that bird 's nest within three or four perch of the pole
chapter_35	for one -PRON- use to lounge up the rigging very leisurely rest in the top to have a chat with queequeg or any one else off duty whom -PRON- may find there then ascend a little way further and throw a lazy leg over the top sail yard take a preliminary view of the watery pasture and so at last mount to -PRON- ultimate destination
chapter_35	let -PRON- make a clean breast of -PRON- here and frankly admit that -PRON- keep but sorry guard
chapter_35	with the problem of the universe revolve in -PRON- how could -PRON- be leave completely to -PRON- at such a thought engender altitude how could -PRON- but lightly hold -PRON- obligation to observe all whale ship stand order keep -PRON- weather eye open and sing out every time
chapter_35	and let -PRON- in this place movingly admonish -PRON- ye ship owner of nantucket
chapter_35	beware of enlist in -PRON- vigilant fishery any lad with lean brow and hollow eye give to unseasonable meditativeness and who offer to ship with the phaedon instead of bowditch in -PRON- head
chapter_35	ten thousand blubber hunter sweep over thee in vain
chapter_35	very often do the captain of such ship take those absent minded young philosopher to task upbraid -PRON- with not feel sufficient interest in the voyage half hint that -PRON- be so hopelessly lost to all honourable ambition as that in -PRON- secret soul -PRON- would rather not see whale than otherwise
chapter_35	but all in vain those young platonist have a notion that -PRON- vision be imperfect -PRON- be short sighted what use then to strain the visual nerve
chapter_35	whale be scarce as hen 's tooth whenever thou art up here
chapter_35	perhaps -PRON- be or perhaps there may have be shoal of -PRON- in the far horizon but lull into such an opium like listlessness of vacant unconscious reverie be this absent minded youth by the blend cadence of wave with thought that at last -PRON- lose -PRON- identity take the mystic ocean at -PRON- foot for the visible image of that deep blue bottomless soul pervade mankind and nature and every strange half see glide beautiful thing that elude -PRON- every dimly discover uprising fin of some undiscernible form seem to -PRON- the embodiment of those elusive thought that only people the soul by continually flit through -PRON-
chapter_35	in this enchant mood thy spirit ebb away to whence -PRON- come become diffuse through time and space like crammer 's sprinkled pantheistic ash form at last a part of every shore the round globe over
chapter_35	but while this sleep this dream be on ye move -PRON- foot or hand an inch slip -PRON- hold at all and -PRON- identity come back in horror
chapter_35	over descartian vortex -PRON- hover
chapter_36	the quarter deck enter ahab
chapter_36	then all
chapter_36	soon -PRON- steady ivory stride be hear as to and fro -PRON- pace -PRON- old round upon plank so familiar to -PRON- tread that -PRON- be all over dent like geological stone with the peculiar mark of -PRON- walk
chapter_36	and so full of -PRON- thought be ahab that at every uniform turn that -PRON- make now at the main mast and now at the binnacle -PRON- could almost see that think turn in -PRON- as -PRON- turn and pace in -PRON- as -PRON- pace so completely possess -PRON- indeed that -PRON- all but seem the inward mould of every outer movement
chapter_36	d'ye mark -PRON- flask
chapter_36	whisper stubb the chick that be in -PRON- peck the shell
chapter_36	twill soon be out
chapter_36	
chapter_36	sir say the mate astonish at an order seldom or never give on ship board except in some extraordinary case
chapter_36	mast head there come down
chapter_36	when the entire ship 's company be assemble and with curious and not wholly unapprehensive face be eye -PRON- for -PRON- look not unlike the weather horizon when a storm be come up ahab after rapidly glance over the bulwark and then dart -PRON- eye among the crew start from -PRON- standpoint and as though not a soul be nigh -PRON- resume -PRON- heavy turn upon the deck
chapter_36	with bent head and half slouched hat -PRON- continue to pace unmindful of the wonder whispering among the man till stubb cautiously whisper to flask that ahab must have summon -PRON- there for the purpose of witness a pedestrian feat
chapter_36	vehemently pause -PRON- cried:-- what do ye do when ye see a whale man
chapter_36	sing out for -PRON-
chapter_36	be the impulsive rejoinder from a score of club voice good
chapter_36	cry ahab with a wild approval in -PRON- tone observe the hearty animation into which -PRON- unexpected question have so magnetically throw -PRON-
chapter_36	and what do ye next man
chapter_36	and what tune be -PRON-
chapter_36	ye pull to man
chapter_36	
chapter_36	a dead whale or a stove boat
chapter_36	but -PRON- be all eagerness again as ahab now half revolving in -PRON- pivot hole with one hand reach high up a shroud and tightly almost convulsively grasp -PRON- address -PRON- thus:--
chapter_36	all ye mast header have before now hear -PRON- give order about a white whale
chapter_36	look ye
chapter_36	d'ye see this spanish ounce of gold
chapter_36	"hold up a broad bright coin to the sun--""it be a sixteen dollar piece man"
chapter_36	d'ye see -PRON-
chapter_36	mr. starbuck hand -PRON- yon top maul
chapter_36	while the mate be get the hammer ahab without speak be slowly rub the gold piece against the skirt of -PRON- jacket as if to heighten -PRON- lustre and without use any word be meanwhile lowly hum to -PRON- produce a sound so strangely muffled and inarticulate that -PRON- seem the mechanical humming of the wheel of -PRON- vitality in -PRON-
chapter_36	
chapter_36	huzza huzza
chapter_36	cry the seaman as with swing tarpaulin -PRON- hail the act of nail the gold to the mast
chapter_36	-PRON- be a white whale -PRON- say resume ahab as -PRON- throw down the topmaul a white whale
chapter_36	skin -PRON- eye for -PRON- man look sharp for white water if ye see but a bubble sing out
chapter_36	captain ahab say tashtego that white whale must be the same that some call moby dick
chapter_36	moby dick shout ahab
chapter_36	do ye know the white whale then tash do -PRON- fan tail a little curious sir before -PRON- go down say the gay header deliberately
chapter_36	and have -PRON- a curious spout too say daggoo very bushy even for a parmacetty and mighty quick captain ahab
chapter_36	
chapter_36	"good many iron in -PRON- hide too captain cry queequeg disjointedly all twiske tee be twisk like -PRON- him-- falter hard for a word and screw -PRON- hand round and round as though uncork a bottle--""like -PRON- him-- corkscrew"
chapter_36	cry ahab aye queequeg the harpoon lie all twisted and wrench in -PRON- aye daggoo -PRON- spout be a big one like a whole shock of wheat and white as a pile of -PRON- nantucket wool after the great annual sheep shearing aye tashtego and -PRON- fan tail like a split jib in a squall
chapter_36	death and devil
chapter_36	man -PRON- be moby dick
chapter_36	ye have see
chapter_36	
chapter_36	
chapter_36	cry ahab then pause aye starbuck aye -PRON- heartie all round -PRON- be moby dick that dismast -PRON-
chapter_36	moby dick that bring -PRON- to this dead stump
chapter_36	aye aye -PRON- shout with a terrific loud animal sob like that of a heart stricken moose aye aye
chapter_36	-PRON- be that accursed white whale that raze -PRON- make a poor peg lubber of -PRON- for ever and a day
chapter_36	and this be what ye have ship for man to chase that white whale on both side of land and over all side of earth till -PRON- spout black blood and roll fin out
chapter_36	what say ye man will ye splice hand on -PRON- now
chapter_36	-PRON- think ye do look brave
chapter_36	
chapter_36	aye aye shout the harpooneer and seaman run closer to the excited old man a sharp eye for the white whale a sharp lance for moby dick
chapter_36	god bless ye -PRON- seem to half sob and half shout
chapter_36	god bless ye man
chapter_36	art not game for moby dick
chapter_36	-PRON- be game for -PRON- crooked jaw and for the jaw of death too captain ahab if -PRON- fairly come in the way of the business -PRON- follow but -PRON- come here to hunt whale not -PRON- commander 's vengeance
chapter_36	hoot
chapter_36	but come closer starbuck thou requirest a little low layer
chapter_36	if money be to be the measurer man and the accountant have compute -PRON- great counting house the globe by girdle -PRON- with guinea one to every three part of an inch then let -PRON- tell thee that -PRON- vengeance will fetch a great premium here
chapter_36	
chapter_36	
chapter_36	vengeance on a dumb brute cry starbuck that simply smite thee from blind instinct
chapter_36	to be enrage with a dumb thing captain ahab seem blasphemous
chapter_36	
chapter_36	but in each event in the living act the undoubted deed there some unknown but still reason thing put forth the moulding of -PRON- feature from behind the unreasoning mask
chapter_36	if man will strike strike through the mask
chapter_36	how can the prisoner reach outside except by thrust through the wall
chapter_36	but not -PRON- master man be even that fair play
chapter_36	who be over -PRON-
chapter_36	truth hath no confine
chapter_36	take off thine eye
chapter_36	more intolerable than fiend glaring be a doltish stare
chapter_36	so so thou redden and pale -PRON- heat have melt thee to anger glow
chapter_36	there be man from whom warm word be small indignity
chapter_36	let -PRON- go
chapter_36	the crew man the crew
chapter_36	be -PRON- not one and all with ahab in this matter of the whale
chapter_36	see stubb
chapter_36	-PRON- laugh
chapter_36	see yonder chilian
chapter_36	stand up amid the general hurricane thy one tost sapling can not starbuck
chapter_36	and what be -PRON-
chapter_36	what be -PRON- more
chapter_36	from this one poor hunt then the good lance out of all nantucket surely -PRON- will not hang back when every foremast hand have clutch a whetstone
chapter_36	the billow lift thee
chapter_36	speak but speak!--aye aye
chapter_36	something shoot from -PRON- dilated nostril -PRON- have inhale -PRON- in -PRON- lung
chapter_36	god keep me!--keep -PRON- all murmur starbuck
chapter_36	for again starbuck 's downcast eye light up with the stubbornness of life
chapter_36	the subterranean laugh die away the wind blow on the sail fill out the ship heave and roll as before
chapter_36	ah ye admonition and warning
chapter_36	why stay ye not when ye come
chapter_36	but rather be ye prediction than warning ye shadow
chapter_36	yet not so much prediction from without as verification of the forego thing within
chapter_36	receive the brim pewter and turn to the harpooneer -PRON- order -PRON- to produce -PRON- weapon
chapter_36	but those wild eye meet -PRON- as the bloodshot eye of the prairie wolf meet the eye of -PRON- leader ere -PRON- rush on at -PRON- head in the trail of the bison but alas only to fall into the hidden snare of the indian drink and pass
chapter_36	so so -PRON- go round excellently
chapter_36	-PRON- spiraliz in ye fork out at the serpent snap eye
chapter_36	that way -PRON- go this way -PRON- come
chapter_36	hand

chapter_36	men ye seem the year so brim life be gulp and go
chapter_36	-PRON- have muster ye all round this capstan and ye mate flank -PRON- with -PRON- lance and ye harpooneer stand there with -PRON- iron and ye stout mariner ring -PRON- in that -PRON- may in some sort revive a noble custom of -PRON- fisherman father before -PRON-
chapter_36	bad penny come not sooner
chapter_36	advance ye mate
chapter_36	cross -PRON- lance full before -PRON-
chapter_36	well do
chapter_36	so say with extended arm -PRON- grasp the three level radiate lance at -PRON- cross centre while so do suddenly and nervously twitch -PRON- meanwhile glance intently from starbuck to stubb from stubb to flask
chapter_36	-PRON- seem as though by some nameless interior volition -PRON- would fain have shocked into -PRON- the same fiery emotion accumulate within the leyden jar of -PRON- own magnetic life
chapter_36	stubb and flask look sideways from -PRON- the honest eye of starbuck fall downright
chapter_36	for do ye three but once take the full force shock then mine own electric thing that have perhaps expire from out -PRON-
chapter_36	perchance ye need -PRON- not
chapter_36	and now ye mate -PRON- do appoint ye three cupbearer to -PRON- three pagan kinsman there yon three most honourable gentleman and nobleman -PRON- valiant harpooneer
chapter_36	what when the great pope wash the foot of beggar use -PRON- tiara for ewer
chapter_36	oh -PRON- sweet cardinal
chapter_36	-PRON- own condescension that shall bend ye to -PRON-
chapter_36	cut -PRON- seizing and draw the pole ye harpooneer
chapter_36	silently obey the order the three harpooneer now stand with the detached iron part of -PRON- harpoon some three foot long hold barb up before -PRON-
chapter_36	stab -PRON- not with that keen steel
chapter_36	turn up the socket
chapter_36	so so now ye cup bearer advance
chapter_36	forthwith slowly go from one officer to the other -PRON- brim the harpoon socket with the fiery water from the pewter
chapter_36	now three to three ye stand
chapter_36	commend the murderous chalice
chapter_36	bestow -PRON- ye who be now make party to this indissoluble league
chapter_36	ha
chapter_36	starbuck
chapter_36	but the deed be do
chapter_36	yon ratify sun now wait to sit upon -PRON-
chapter_36	drink ye harpooneer drink and swear ye man that man the deathful whaleboat 's bow death to moby dick
chapter_36	the long barb steel goblet be lift and to cry and malediction against the white whale the spirit be simultaneously quaff down with a hiss
chapter_36	once more and finally the replenish pewter go the round among the frantic crew when wave -PRON- free hand to -PRON- -PRON- all disperse and ahab retire within -PRON- cabin
chapter_37	sunset
chapter_37	-PRON- leave a white and turbid wake pale water pale cheek where'er -PRON- sail
chapter_37	the envious billow sidelong swell to whelm -PRON- track let -PRON- but first -PRON- pass
chapter_37	the gold brow plumb the blue
chapter_37	the diver sun slow dive from noon go down -PRON- soul mount up
chapter_37	-PRON- weary with -PRON- endless hill
chapter_37	be then the crown too heavy that -PRON- wear
chapter_37	this iron crown of lombardy

chapter_41	moby dick
chapter_41	-PRON- ishmael be one of that crew -PRON- shout have go up with the rest -PRON- oath have be weld with -PRON- and strong -PRON- shout and more do -PRON- hammer and clinch -PRON- oath because of the dread in -PRON- soul
chapter_41	a wild mystical sympathetical feeling be in -PRON- ahab 's quenchless feud seem -PRON-
chapter_41	for some time past though at interval only the unaccompanied secluded white whale have haunt those uncivilized sea mostly frequent by the sperm whale fisherman
chapter_41	but not all of -PRON- know of -PRON- existence only a few of -PRON- comparatively have knowingly see -PRON- while the number who as yet have actually and knowingly give battle to -PRON- be small indeed
chapter_41	for owe to the large number of whale cruiser the disorderly way -PRON- be sprinkle over the entire watery circumference many of -PRON- adventurously push -PRON- quest along solitary latitude so as seldom or never for a whole twelvemonth or more on a stretch to encounter a single news tell sail of any sort the inordinate length of each separate voyage the irregularity of the time of sailing from home all these with other circumstance direct and indirect long obstruct the spread through the whole world wide whaling fleet of the special individualize tiding concern moby dick
chapter_41	-PRON- be hardly to be doubt that several vessel report to have encounter at such or such a time or on such or such a meridian a sperm whale of uncommon magnitude and malignity which whale after do great mischief to -PRON- assailant have completely escape -PRON- to some mind -PRON- be not an unfair presumption -PRON- say that the whale in question must have be no other than moby dick
chapter_41	yet as of late the sperm whale fishery have be mark by various and not unfrequent instance of great ferocity cunning and malice in the monster attack therefore -PRON- be that those who by accident ignorantly give battle to moby dick such hunter perhaps for the most part be content to ascribe the peculiar terror -PRON- breed more as -PRON- be to the peril of the sperm whale fishery at large than to the individual because
chapter_41	but at length such calamity do ensue in these assault not restrict to sprain wrist and ankle break limb or devour amputation but fatal to the last degree of fatality those repeat disastrous repulse all accumulate and pile -PRON- terror upon moby dick those thing have go far to shake the fortitude of many brave hunter to whom the story of the white whale have eventually come
chapter_41	nor do wild rumor of all sort fail to exaggerate and still the more horrify the true history of these deadly encounter
chapter_41	for not only do fabulous rumor naturally grow out of the very body of all surprising terrible event as the smitten tree give birth to -PRON- fungus but in maritime life far more than in that of terra firma wild rumor abound wherever there be any adequate reality for -PRON- to cling to
chapter_41	no wonder then that ever gather volume from the mere transit over the wide watery space the outblown rumor of the white whale do in the end incorporate with -PRON- all manner of morbid hint and half form foetal suggestion of supernatural agency which eventually invest moby dick with new terror unborrow from anything that visibly appear
chapter_41	but there be still other and more vital practical influence at work
chapter_41	nor be the pre eminent tremendousness of the great sperm whale anywhere more feelingly comprehend than on board of those prow which stem -PRON-
chapter_41	and as if the now test reality of -PRON- might have in former legendary time throw -PRON- shadow before -PRON- -PRON- find some book naturalist olassen and povelson declare the sperm whale not only to be a consternation to every other creature in the sea but also to be so incredibly ferocious as continually to be athirst for human blood
chapter_41	nor even down to so late a time as cuvier 's be these or almost similar impression efface
chapter_41	for in -PRON- natural history the baron -PRON- affirm that at sight of the sperm whale all fish shark include be strike with the most lively terror and often in the precipitancy of -PRON- flight dash -PRON- against the rock with such violence as to because instantaneous death
chapter_41	and however the general experience in the fishery may amend such report as these yet in -PRON- full terribleness even to the bloodthirsty item of povelson the superstitious belief in -PRON- be in some vicissitude of -PRON- vocation revive in the mind of the hunter
chapter_41	so that overawe by the rumor and portent concern -PRON- not a few of the fisherman recall in reference to moby dick the early day of the sperm whale fishery when -PRON- be oftentimes hard to induce long practise right whaleman to embark in the peril of this new and daring warfare such man protest that although other leviathan may be hopefully pursue yet to chase and point lance at such an apparition as the sperm whale be not for mortal man
chapter_41	that to attempt -PRON- would be inevitably to be tear into a quick eternity
chapter_41	nevertheless some there be who even in the face of these thing be ready to give chase to moby dick and a still great number who chance only to hear of -PRON- distantly and vaguely without the specific detail of any certain calamity and without superstitious accompaniment be sufficiently hardy not to flee from the battle if offer
chapter_41	one of the wild suggestion refer to as at last come to be link with the white whale in the mind of the superstitiously inclined be the unearthly conceit that moby dick be ubiquitous that -PRON- have actually be encounter in opposite latitude at one and the same instant of time
chapter_41	nor credulous as such mind must have be be this conceit altogether without some faint show of superstitious probability
chapter_41	for as the secret of the current in the sea have never yet be divulge even to the most erudite research so the hide way of the sperm whale when beneath the surface remain in great part unaccountable to -PRON- pursuer and from time to time have originate the most curious and contradictory speculation regard -PRON- especially concern the mystic mode whereby after sound to a great depth -PRON- transport -PRON- with such vast swiftness to the most widely distant point
chapter_41	-PRON- be a thing well known to both american and english whale ship and as well a thing place upon authoritative record year ago by scoresby that some whale have be capture far north in the pacific in whose body have be find the barb of harpoon dart in the greenland sea
chapter_41	nor be -PRON- to be gainsay that in some of these instance -PRON- have be declare that the interval of time between the two assault could not have exceed very many day
chapter_41	hence by inference -PRON- have be believe by some whaleman that the nor west passage so long a problem to man be never a problem to the whale
chapter_41	so that here in the real living experience of live man the prodigy relate in old time of the inland strello mountain in portugal near whose top there be say to be a lake in which the wreck of ship float up to the surface and that still more wonderful story of the arethusa fountain near syracuse whose water be believe to have come from the holy land by an underground passage these fabulous narration be almost fully equal by the reality of the whaleman
chapter_41	but even strip of these supernatural surmising there be enough in the earthly make and incontestable character of the monster to strike the imagination with unwonted power
chapter_41	for -PRON- be not so much -PRON- uncommon bulk that so much distinguish -PRON- from other sperm whale but as be elsewhere throw out a peculiar snow white wrinkled forehead and a high pyramidical white hump
chapter_41	these be -PRON- prominent feature the token whereby even in the limitless uncharted sea -PRON- reveal -PRON- identity at a long distance to those who know -PRON-
chapter_41	the rest of -PRON- body be so streak and spot and marble with the same shrouded hue that in the end -PRON- have gain -PRON- distinctive appellation of the white whale a name indeed literally justified by -PRON- vivid aspect when see glide at high noon through a dark blue sea leave a milky way wake of creamy foam all spangled with golden gleaming
chapter_41	nor be -PRON- -PRON- unwonted magnitude nor -PRON- remarkable hue nor yet -PRON- deform low jaw that so much invest the whale with natural terror as that unexampl intelligent malignity which accord to specific account -PRON- have over and over again evince in -PRON- assault
chapter_41	more than all -PRON- treacherous retreat strike more of dismay than perhaps aught else
chapter_41	already several fatality have attend -PRON- chase
chapter_41	but though similar disaster however little bruit ashore be by no means unusual in the fishery yet in most instance such seem the white whale 's infernal aforethought of ferocity that every dismember or death that -PRON- cause be not wholly regard as have be inflict by an unintelligent agent
chapter_41	-PRON- three boat stove around -PRON- and oar and man both whirl in the eddy one captain seize the line knife from -PRON- broken prow have dash at the whale as an arkansas duellist at -PRON- foe blindly seek with a six inch blade to reach the fathom deep life of the whale
chapter_41	that captain be ahab
chapter_41	no turbaned turk no hire venetian or malay could have smite -PRON- with more seeming malice
chapter_41	small reason be there to doubt then that ever since that almost fatal encounter ahab have cherish a wild vindictiveness against the whale all the more fall for that in -PRON- frantic morbidness -PRON- at last come to identify with -PRON- not only all -PRON- bodily woe but all -PRON- intellectual and spiritual exasperation
chapter_41	the white whale swim before -PRON- as the monomaniac incarnation of all those malicious agency which some deep man feel eat in -PRON- till -PRON- be leave live on with half a heart and half a lung
chapter_41	that intangible malignity which have be from the beginning to whose dominion even the modern christians ascribe one half of the world which the ancient ophites of the east reverenced in -PRON- statue devil ahab do not fall down and worship -PRON- like -PRON- but deliriously transfer -PRON- idea to the abhor white whale -PRON- pit -PRON- all mutilate against -PRON-
chapter_41	all that most madden and torment all that stir up the lee of thing all truth with malice in -PRON- all that crack the sinew and cake the brain all the subtle demonism of life and think all evil to crazy ahab be visibly personify and make practically assailable in moby dick
chapter_41	-PRON- pile upon the whale 's white hump the sum of all the general rage and hate feel by -PRON- whole race from adam down and then as if -PRON- chest have be a mortar -PRON- burst -PRON- hot heart 's shell upon -PRON-
chapter_41	then in dart at the monster knife in hand -PRON- have but give loose to a sudden passionate corporal animosity and when -PRON- receive the stroke that tear -PRON- -PRON- probably but feel the agonizing bodily laceration but nothing more
chapter_41	that -PRON- be only then on the homeward voyage after the encounter that the final monomania seize -PRON- seem all but certain from the fact that at interval during the passage -PRON- be a rave lunatic and though unlimbed of a leg yet such vital strength yet lurk in -PRON- egyptian chest and be moreover intensify by -PRON- delirium that -PRON- mate be force to lace -PRON- fast even there as -PRON- sail rave in -PRON- hammock
chapter_41	in a strait jacket -PRON- swing to the mad rocking of the gale
chapter_41	and when run into more sufferable latitude the ship with mild stun'sail spread float across the tranquil tropic and to all appearance the old man 's delirium seem leave behind -PRON- with the cape horn swell and -PRON- come forth from -PRON- dark den into the blessed light and air even then when -PRON- bear that firm collect front however pale and issue -PRON- calm order once again and -PRON- mate thank god the direful madness be now go even then ahab in -PRON- hidden self rave on
chapter_41	when -PRON- think -PRON- flee -PRON- may have but become transfigure into some still subtle form
chapter_41	ahab 's full lunacy subside not but deepeningly contract like the unabated hudson when that noble northman flow narrowly but unfathomably through the highland gorge
chapter_41	but as in -PRON- narrow flow monomania not one jot of ahab 's broad madness have be leave behind so in that broad madness not one jot of -PRON- great natural intellect have perish
chapter_41	if such a furious trope may stand -PRON- special lunacy storm -PRON- general sanity and carry -PRON- and turn all -PRON- concentre cannon upon -PRON- own mad mark so that far from have lose -PRON- strength ahab to that one end do now possess a thousand fold more potency than ever -PRON- have sanely bring to bear upon any one reasonable object
chapter_41	but vain to popularize profundity and all truth be profound
chapter_41	so with a break throne the great god mock that captive king so like a caryatid -PRON- patient sit uphold on -PRON- frozen brow the pile entablature of age
chapter_41	wind ye down there ye prouder sad soul
chapter_41	question that proud sad king
chapter_41	a family likeness
chapter_41	aye -PRON- do beget ye ye young exile royalty and from -PRON- grim sire only will the old state secret come
chapter_41	now in -PRON- heart ahab have some glimpse of this namely all -PRON- mean be sane -PRON- motive and -PRON- object mad
chapter_41	but that thing of -PRON- dissembling be only subject to -PRON- perceptibility not to -PRON- will determinate
chapter_41	nevertheless so well do -PRON- succeed in that dissembling that when with ivory leg -PRON- step ashore at last no nantucketer think -PRON- otherwise than but naturally grieve and that to the quick with the terrible casualty which have overtake -PRON-
chapter_41	the report of -PRON- undeniable delirium at sea be likewise popularly ascribe to a kindred because
chapter_41	and so too all the add moodiness which always afterwards to the very day of sailing in the pequod on the present voyage sit brooding on -PRON- brow
chapter_41	nor be -PRON- so very unlikely that far from distrust -PRON- fitness for another whaling voyage on account of such dark symptom the calculate people of that prudent isle be incline to harbor the conceit that for those very reason -PRON- be all the better qualified and set on edge for a pursuit so full of rage and wildness as the bloody hunt of whale
chapter_41	gnaw within and scorch without with the infixed unrelenting fang of some incurable idea such an one could -PRON- be find would seem the very man to dart -PRON- iron and lift -PRON- lance against the most appalling of all brute
chapter_41	or if for any reason think to be corporeally incapacitated for that yet such an one would seem superlatively competent to cheer and howl on -PRON- underling to the attack
chapter_41	but be all this as -PRON- may certain -PRON- be that with the mad secret of -PRON- unabated rage bolt up and key in -PRON- ahab have purposely sail upon the present voyage with the one only and all engrossing object of hunt the white whale
chapter_41	-PRON- be bent on profitable cruise the profit to be count down in dollar from the mint
chapter_41	-PRON- be intent on an audacious immitigable and supernatural revenge
chapter_41	here then be this grey head ungodly old man chase with curse a job 's whale round the world at the head of a crew too chiefly make up of mongrel renegade and castaway and cannibal morally enfeebled also by the incompetence of mere unaided virtue or right mindedness in starbuck the invunerable jollity of indifference and recklessness in stubb and the pervade mediocrity in flask
chapter_41	such a crew so officered seem specially pick and pack by some infernal fatality to help -PRON- to -PRON- monomaniac revenge
chapter_41	how -PRON- be that -PRON- so aboundingly respond to the old man 's ire by what evil magic -PRON- soul be possess that at time -PRON- hate seem almost -PRON- the white whale as much -PRON- insufferable foe as -PRON- how all this come to be what the white whale be to -PRON- or how to -PRON- unconscious understanding also in some dim unsuspected way -PRON- may have seem the glide great demon of the sea of life all this to explain would be to dive deeper than ishmael can go
chapter_41	the subterranean miner that work in -PRON- all how can one tell whither lead -PRON- shaft by the ever shift muffled sound of -PRON- pick
chapter_41	who do not feel the irresistible arm drag
chapter_41	what skiff in tow of a seventy four can stand still
chapter_41	for one -PRON- give -PRON- up to the abandonment of the time and the place but while yet all a rush to encounter the whale could see naught in that brute but the deadly ill
chapter_42	the whiteness of the whale
chapter_42	-PRON- be the whiteness of the whale that above all thing appal -PRON-
chapter_42	but how can -PRON- hope to explain -PRON- here and yet in some dim random way explain -PRON-
chapter_42	-PRON- must else all these chapter may be naught
chapter_42	though in many natural object whiteness refiningly enhance beauty as if impart some special virtue of -PRON- own as in marble japonicas and pearl and though various nation have in some way recognise a certain royal preeminence in this hue even the barbaric grand old king of pegu place the title lord of the white elephants above all -PRON- other magniloquent ascription of dominion and the modern king of siam unfurl the same snow white quadruped in the royal standard and the hanoverian flag bear the one figure of a snow white charger and the great austrian empire caesarian heir to overlord rome have for the imperial colour the same imperial hue and though this pre eminence in -PRON- apply to the human race -PRON- give the white man ideal mastership over every dusky tribe and though besides all this whiteness have be even make significant of gladness for among the romans a white stone mark a joyful day and though in other mortal sympathy and symbolizing this same hue be make the emblem of many touching noble thing the innocence of bride the benignity of age though among the red men of america the giving of the white belt of wampum be the deep pledge of honour though in many clime whiteness typify the majesty of justice in the ermine of the judge and contribute to the daily state of king and queen draw by milk white steed though even in the high mystery of the most august religion -PRON- have be make the symbol of the divine spotlessness and power by the persian fire worshipper the white forked flame be hold the holy on the altar and in the greek mythology great jove -PRON- be make incarnate in a snow white bull and though to the noble iroquois the midwinter sacrifice of the sacred white dog be by far the holy festival of -PRON- theology that spotless faithful creature be hold the pure envoy -PRON- could send to the great spirit with the annual tiding of -PRON- own fidelity and though directly from the latin word for white all christian priest derive the name of one part of -PRON- sacred vesture the alb or tunic wear beneath the cassock and though among the holy pomp of the romish faith white be specially employ in the celebration of the passion of -PRON- lord though in the vision of st. john white robe be give to the redeem and the four and twenty elder stand clothe in white before the great white throne and the holy one that sitteth there white like wool yet for all these accumulate association with whatev be sweet and honourable and sublime there yet lurk an elusive something in the innermost idea of this hue which strike more of panic to the soul than that redness which affright in blood
chapter_42	witness the white bear of the pole and the white shark of the tropic
chapter_42	what but -PRON- smooth flaky whiteness make -PRON- the transcendent horror -PRON- be
chapter_42	so that not the fierce fanged tiger in -PRON- heraldic coat can so stagger courage as the white shroud bear or shark
chapter_42	
chapter_42	but even assume all this to be true yet be -PRON- not for the whiteness -PRON- would not have that intensify terror
chapter_42	as for the white shark the white gliding ghostliness of repose in that creature when behold in -PRON- ordinary mood strangely tally with the same quality in the polar quadruped
chapter_42	bethink thee of the albatross whence come those cloud of spiritual wonderment and pale dread in which that white phantom sail in all imagination
chapter_42	not coleridge first throw that spell but god 's great unflattering laureate nature
chapter_42	-PRON- remember the first albatross -PRON- ever see
chapter_42	-PRON- be during a prolonged gale in water hard upon the antarctic sea
chapter_42	from -PRON- forenoon watch below -PRON- ascend to the overclouded deck and there dash upon the main hatch -PRON- see a regal feathery thing of unspotted whiteness and with a hooked roman bill sublime
chapter_42	at interval -PRON- arch forth -PRON- vast archangel wing as if to embrace some holy ark
chapter_42	though bodily unharmed -PRON- utter cry as some king 's ghost in supernatural distress
chapter_42	through -PRON- inexpressible strange eye methought
chapter_42	-PRON- can not tell can only hint the thing that dart through -PRON- then
chapter_42	goney
chapter_42	never have hear that name before be -PRON- conceivable that this glorious thing be utterly unknown to man ashore never
chapter_42	but some time after -PRON- learn that goney be some seaman 's name for albatross
chapter_42	yet in say this -PRON- do but indirectly burnish a little bright the noble merit of the poem and the poet
chapter_42	but how have the mystic thing be catch
chapter_42	at last the captain make a postman of -PRON- tie a lettered leathern tally round -PRON- neck with the ship 's time and place and then let -PRON- escape
chapter_42	but -PRON- doubt not that leathern tally mean for man be take off in heaven when the white fowl fly to join the wing folding the invoking and adore cherub
chapter_42	-PRON- be the elect xerxes of vast herd of wild horse whose pasture in those day be only fence by the rocky mountains and the alleghanies
chapter_42	at -PRON- flaming head -PRON- westward troop -PRON- like that choose star which every evening lead on the host of light
chapter_42	whether marching amid -PRON- aide and marshal in the van of countless cohort that endlessly stream -PRON- over the plain like an ohio or whether with -PRON- circumambient subject browse all around at the horizon the white steed gallopingly review -PRON- with warm nostril redden through -PRON- cool milkiness in whatev aspect -PRON- present -PRON- always to the brave indians -PRON- be the object of tremble reverence and awe
chapter_42	nor can -PRON- be question from what stand on legendary record of this noble horse that -PRON- be -PRON- spiritual whiteness chiefly which so clothe -PRON- with divineness and that this divineness have that in -PRON- which though command worship at the same time enforce a certain nameless terror
chapter_42	but there be other instance where this whiteness lose all that accessory and strange glory which invest -PRON- in the white steed and albatross
chapter_42	what be -PRON- that in the albino man so peculiarly repel and often shock the eye as that sometimes -PRON- be loathe by -PRON- own kith and kin
chapter_42	from -PRON- snowy aspect the gauntleted ghost of the southern seas have be denominate the white squall
chapter_42	nor in some thing do the common hereditary experience of all mankind fail to bear witness to the supernaturalism of this hue
chapter_42	-PRON- can not well be doubt that the one visible quality in the aspect of the dead which most appal the gazer be the marble pallor linger there as if indeed that pallor be as much like the badge of consternation in the other world as of mortal trepidation here
chapter_42	nor even in -PRON- superstition do -PRON- fail to throw the same snowy mantle round -PRON- phantom all ghost rise in a milk white fog
chapter_42	yea while these terror seize -PRON- let -PRON- add that even the king of terror when personify by the evangelist rid on -PRON- pallid horse
chapter_42	therefore in -PRON- other mood symbolize whatev grand or gracious thing -PRON- will by whiteness no man can deny that in -PRON- profound idealized significance -PRON- call up a peculiar apparition to the soul
chapter_42	but though without dissent this point be fix how be mortal man to account for -PRON-
chapter_42	to analyse -PRON- would seem impossible
chapter_42	let -PRON- try
chapter_42	but in a matter like this subtlety appeal to subtlety and without imagination no man can follow another into these hall
chapter_42	and though doubtless some at least of the imaginative impression about to be present may have be share by most man yet few perhaps be entirely conscious of -PRON- at the time and therefore may not be able to recall -PRON- now
chapter_42	why to the man of untutored ideality who happen to be but loosely acquaint with the peculiar character of the day do the bare mention of whitsuntide marshal in the fancy such long dreary speechless procession of slow pacing pilgrim down cast and hooded with new fall snow
chapter_42	or to the unread unsophisticated protestant of the middle american states why do the pass mention of a white friar or a white nun evoke such an eyeless statue in the soul
chapter_42	or what be there apart from the tradition of dungeoned warrior and king which will not wholly account for -PRON- that make the white tower of london tell so much more strongly on the imagination of an untravelled american than those other storied structure -PRON- neighbor the byward tower or even the bloody
chapter_42	and those sublimer tower the white mountains of new hampshire whence in peculiar mood come that gigantic ghostliness over the soul at the bare mention of that name while the thought of virginia 's blue ridge be full of a soft dewy distant dreaminess
chapter_42	nor be -PRON- altogether the remembrance of -PRON- cathedral topple earthquake nor the stampedoe of -PRON- frantic sea nor the tearlessness of arid sky that never rain nor the sight of -PRON- wide field of lean spire wrench cope stone and cross all adroop like canted yard of anchor fleet and -PRON- suburban avenue of house wall lie over upon each other as a toss pack of card -PRON- be not these thing alone which make tearless lima the strange sad city thou can'st see
chapter_42	-PRON- know that to the common apprehension this phenomenon of whiteness be not confess to be the prime agent in exaggerate the terror of object otherwise terrible nor to the unimaginative mind be there aught of terror in those appearance whose awfulness to another mind almost solely consist in this one phenomenon especially when exhibit under any form at all approach to muteness or universality
chapter_42	what -PRON- mean by these two statement may perhaps be respectively elucidate by the follow example
chapter_42	yet where be the mariner who will tell thee sir -PRON- be not so much the fear of strike hidden rock as the fear of that hideous whiteness that so stir -PRON-
chapter_42	
chapter_42	second
chapter_42	much the same be -PRON- with the backwoodsman of the west who with comparative indifference view an unbounded prairie sheet with drive snow no shadow of tree or twig to break the fix trance of whiteness
chapter_42	not so the sailor behold the scenery of the antarctic sea where at time by some infernal trick of legerdemain in the power of frost and air -PRON- shiver and half shipwreck instead of rainbow speaking hope and solace to -PRON- misery view what seem a boundless churchyard grin upon -PRON- with -PRON- lean ice monument and splintered cross
chapter_42	there be no remembrance in -PRON- of any goring of wild creature in -PRON- green northern home so that the strange muskiness -PRON- smell can not recall to -PRON- anything associate with the experience of former peril for what know -PRON- this new england colt of the black bison of distant oregon
chapter_42	though thousand of mile from oregon still when -PRON- smell that savage musk the rending goring bison herd be as present as to the deserted wild foal of the prairie which this instant -PRON- may be trample into dust
chapter_42	thus then the muffled rolling of a milky sea the bleak rustling of the festoon frost of mountain the desolate shifting of the windrow snow of prairie all these to ishmael be as the shake of that buffalo robe to the frightened colt
chapter_42	though neither know where lie the nameless thing of which the mystic sign give forth such hint yet with -PRON- as with the colt somewhere those thing must exist
chapter_42	though in many of -PRON- aspect this visible world seem form in love the invisible sphere be form in fright
chapter_42	but not yet have -PRON- solve the incantation of this whiteness and learn why -PRON- appeal with such power to the soul and more strange and far more portentous why as -PRON- have see -PRON- be at once the most meaning symbol of spiritual thing nay the very veil of the christian 's deity and yet should be as -PRON- be the intensify agent in thing the most appalling to mankind
chapter_42	be -PRON- that by -PRON- indefiniteness -PRON- shadow forth the heartless void and immensity of the universe and thus stab -PRON- from behind with the thought of annihilation when behold the white depth of the milky way
chapter_42	or be -PRON- that as in essence whiteness be not so much a colour as the visible absence of colour and at the same time the concrete of all colour be -PRON- for these reason that there be such a dumb blankness full of meaning in a wide landscape of snow a colourless all colour of atheism from which -PRON- shrink
chapter_42	and when -PRON- consider that other theory of the natural philosopher that all other earthly hue every stately or lovely emblazoning the sweet tinge of sunset sky and wood yea and the gilded velvet of butterflies and the butterfly cheek of young girl all these be but subtile deceit not actually inherent in substance but only lay on from without so that all deify nature absolutely paint like the harlot whose allurement cover nothing but the charnel house within and when -PRON- proceed further and consider that the mystical cosmetic which produce every one of -PRON- hue the great principle of light for ever remain white or colourless in -PRON- and if operate without medium upon matter would touch all object even tulip and rose with -PRON- own blank tinge ponder all this the palsied universe lie before -PRON- a leper and like wilful traveller in lapland who refuse to wear coloured and colouring glass upon -PRON- eye so the wretched infidel gaze -PRON- blind at the monumental white shroud that wrap all the prospect around -PRON-
chapter_42	and of all these thing the albino whale be the symbol
chapter_42	wonder ye then at the fiery hunt
chapter_43	in this manner -PRON- pass the bucket to fill the scuttle butt
chapter_43	standing for the most part on the hallowed precinct of the quarter deck -PRON- be careful not to speak or rustle -PRON- foot
chapter_43	do -PRON- hear that noise cabaco
chapter_43	there -PRON- be again under the hatch don't -PRON- hear -PRON- a cough -PRON- sound like a cough
chapter_43	cough be damned
chapter_43	pass along that return bucket
chapter_43	
chapter_43	there again there -PRON- is!--it sound like two or three sleeper turn over now
chapter_43	caramba have do shipmate will ye
chapter_43	look to the bucket
chapter_43	
chapter_43	say what ye will shipmate -PRON- have sharp ear
chapter_43	aye -PRON- be the chap be not ye that hear the hum of the old quakeress 's knitting needle fifty mile at sea from nantucket -PRON- be the chap
chapter_43	grin away -PRON- will see what turn up
chapter_43	hark ye cabaco there be somebody down in the after hold that have not yet be see on deck and -PRON- suspect -PRON- old mogul know something of -PRON- too
chapter_43	-PRON- hear stubb tell flask one morning watch that there be something of that sort in the wind
chapter_43	
chapter_43	tish
chapter_43	the bucket
chapter_44	the chart
chapter_44	at interval -PRON- would refer to pile of old log book beside -PRON- wherein be set down the season and place in which on various former voyage of various ship sperm whale have be capture or see
chapter_44	while thus employ the heavy pewter lamp suspend in chain over -PRON- head continually rock with the motion of the ship and for ever throw shift gleam and shadow of line upon -PRON- wrinkled brow till -PRON- almost seem that while -PRON- -PRON- be mark out line and course on the wrinkled chart some invisible pencil be also trace line and course upon the deeply marked chart of -PRON- forehead
chapter_44	but -PRON- be not this night in particular that in the solitude of -PRON- cabin ahab thus ponder over -PRON- chart
chapter_44	almost every night -PRON- be bring out almost every night some pencil mark be efface and other be substitute
chapter_44	for with the chart of all four ocean before -PRON- ahab be thread a maze of current and eddy with a view to the more certain accomplishment of that monomaniac thought of -PRON- soul
chapter_44	now to any one not fully acquaint with the way of the leviathan -PRON- may seem an absurdly hopeless task thus to seek out one solitary creature in the unhooped ocean of this planet
chapter_44	so assure indeed be the fact concern the periodicalness of the sperm whale 's resort to give water that many hunter believe that could -PRON- be closely observe and study throughout the world be the log for one voyage of the entire whale fleet carefully collate then the migration of the sperm whale would be find to correspond in invariability to those of the herring shoal or the flight of swallow
chapter_44	
chapter_44	this chart divide the ocean into district of five degree of latitude by five degree of longitude perpendicularly through each of which district be twelve column for the twelve month and horizontally through each of which district be three line one to show the number of day that have be spend in each month in every district and the two other to show the number of day in which whale sperm or right have be see
chapter_44	though in these case the direction take by any one whale be straight as a surveyor 's parallel and though the line of advance be strictly confine to -PRON- own unavoidable straight wake yet the arbitrary vein in which at these time -PRON- be say to swim generally embrace some few mile in width more or less as the vein be presume to expand or contract but never exceed the visual sweep from the whale ship 's mast head when circumspectly glide along this magic zone
chapter_44	the sum be that at particular season within that breadth and along that path migrate whale may with great confidence be look for
chapter_44	but not so in the reality perhaps
chapter_44	in general the same remark only within a less wide limit apply to the solitary and hermit among the mature aged sperm whale
chapter_44	so that though moby dick have in a former year be see for example on what be call the seychelle ground in the indian ocean or volcano bay on the japanese coast yet -PRON- do not follow that be the pequod to visit either of those spot at any subsequent correspond season -PRON- would infallibly encounter -PRON- there
chapter_44	so too with some other feeding ground where -PRON- have at time reveal -PRON-
chapter_44	but all these seem only -PRON- casual stopping place and ocean inn so to speak not -PRON- place of prolong abode
chapter_44	and where ahab 's chance of accomplish -PRON- object have hitherto be speak of allusion have only be make to whatev way side antecedent extra prospect be -PRON- ere a particular set time or place be attain when all possibility would become probability and as ahab fondly think every possibility the next thing to a certainty
chapter_44	that particular set time and place be conjoined in the one technical phrase the season on the line
chapter_44	for there and then for several consecutive year moby dick have be periodically descry linger in those water for awhile as the sun in -PRON- annual round loiter for a predict interval in any one sign of the zodiac
chapter_44	there -PRON- be too that most of the deadly encounter with the white whale have take place there the wave be storied with -PRON- deed there also be that tragic spot where the monomaniac old man have find the awful motive to -PRON- vengeance
chapter_44	but in the cautious comprehensiveness and unloiter vigilance with which ahab throw -PRON- brooding soul into this unfaltering hunt -PRON- would not permit -PRON- to rest all -PRON- hope upon the one crowning fact above mention however flatter -PRON- may be to those hope nor in the sleeplessness of -PRON- vow could -PRON- so tranquillize -PRON- unquiet heart as to postpone all intervene quest
chapter_44	now the pequod have sail from nantucket at the very beginning of the season on the line
chapter_44	no possible endeavor then could enable -PRON- commander to make the great passage southwards double cape horn and then run down sixty degree of latitude arrive in the equatorial pacific in time to cruise there
chapter_44	therefore -PRON- must wait for the next ensue season
chapter_44	yet the premature hour of the pequod 's sailing have perhaps be correctly select by ahab with a view to this very complexion of thing
chapter_44	because an interval of three hundred and sixty five day and night be before -PRON- an interval which instead of impatiently endure ashore -PRON- would spend in a miscellaneous hunt if by chance the white whale spend -PRON- vacation in sea far remote from -PRON- periodical feeding ground should turn up -PRON- wrinkled brow off the persian gulf or in the bengal bay or china seas or in any other water haunt by -PRON- race
chapter_44	so that monsoons pampas nor'-westers harmattans trades any wind but the levanter and simoon may blow moby dick into the devious zig zag world circle of the pequod 's circumnavigate wake
chapter_44	but grant all this yet regard discreetly and coolly seem -PRON- not but a mad idea this that in the broad boundless ocean one solitary whale even if encounter should be think capable of individual recognition from -PRON- hunter even as a white bearded mufti in the thronged thoroughfare of constantinople
chapter_44	yes
chapter_44	for the peculiar snow white brow of moby dick and -PRON- snow white hump could not but be unmistakable
chapter_44	and have -PRON- not tally the whale ahab would mutter to -PRON- as after pore over -PRON- chart till long after midnight -PRON- would throw -PRON- back in reverie tally -PRON- and shall -PRON- escape
chapter_44	and here -PRON- mad mind would run on in a breathless race till a weariness and faintness of ponder come over -PRON- and in the open air of the deck -PRON- would seek to recover -PRON- strength
chapter_44	what trance of torment do that man endure who be consume with one unachieved revengeful desire
chapter_44	-PRON- sleep with clenched hand and wake with -PRON- own bloody nail in -PRON- palm
chapter_44	often when force from -PRON- hammock by exhausting and intolerably vivid dream of the night which resume -PRON- own intense thought through the day carry -PRON- on amid a clashing of phrensie and whirl -PRON- round and round and round in -PRON- blaze brain till the very throbbing of -PRON- life spot become insufferable anguish and when as be sometimes the case these spiritual throe in -PRON- heave -PRON- be up from -PRON- base and a chasm seem open in -PRON- from which fork flame and lightning shoot up and accursed fiend beckon -PRON- to leap down among -PRON- when this hell in -PRON- yawn beneath -PRON- a wild cry would be hear through the ship and with glaring eye ahab would burst from -PRON- state room as though escape from a bed that be on fire
chapter_44	yet these perhaps instead of be the unsuppressable symptom of some latent weakness or fright at -PRON- own resolve be but the plain token of -PRON- intensity
chapter_44	for at such time crazy ahab the scheming unappeasedly steadfast hunter of the white whale this ahab that have go to -PRON- hammock be not the agent that so cause -PRON- to burst from -PRON- in horror again
chapter_44	god help thee old man thy thought have create a creature in thee and -PRON- whose intense thinking thus make -PRON- a prometheus a vulture feed upon that heart for ever that vulture the very creature -PRON- create
chapter_45	the affidavit
chapter_45	so far as what there may be of a narrative in this book and indeed as indirectly touch one or two very interesting and curious particular in the habit of sperm whale the forego chapter in -PRON- early part be as important a one as will be find in this volume but the lead matter of -PRON- require to be still further and more familiarly enlarge upon in order to be adequately understand and moreover to take away any incredulity which a profound ignorance of the entire subject may induce in some mind as to the natural verity of the main point of this affair
chapter_45	-PRON- care not to perform this part of -PRON- task methodically but shall be content to produce the desire impression by separate citation of item practically or reliably know to -PRON- as a whaleman and from these citation -PRON- take -PRON- the conclusion aim at will naturally follow of -PRON-
chapter_45	meanwhile the whale -PRON- have strike must also have be on -PRON- travel no doubt -PRON- have thrice circumnavigate the globe brush with -PRON- flank all the coast of africa but to no purpose
chapter_45	-PRON- say -PRON- -PRON- have know three instance similar to this that be in two of -PRON-
chapter_45	-PRON- see the whale strike and upon the second attack see the two iron with the respective mark cut in -PRON- afterwards take from the dead fish
chapter_45	-PRON- say three year but -PRON- be pretty sure -PRON- be more than that
chapter_45	here be three instance then which -PRON- personally know the truth of but -PRON- have hear of many other instance from person whose veracity in the matter there be no good ground to impeach
chapter_45	secondly -PRON- be well know in the sperm whale fishery however ignorant the world ashore may be of -PRON- that there have be several memorable historical instance where a particular whale in the ocean have be at distant time and place popularly cognisable
chapter_45	why such a whale become thus mark be not altogether and originally owe to -PRON- bodily peculiarity as distinguish from other whale for however peculiar in that respect any chance whale may be -PRON- soon put an end to -PRON- peculiarity by kill -PRON- and boil -PRON- down into a peculiarly valuable oil
chapter_45	no the reason be this that from the fatal experience of the fishery there hang a terrible prestige of perilousness about such a whale as there do about rinaldo rinaldini insomuch that most fisherman be content to recognise -PRON- by merely touch -PRON- tarpaulin when -PRON- would be discover lounge by -PRON- on the sea without seek to cultivate a more intimate acquaintance
chapter_45	but not only do each of these famous whale enjoy great individual celebrity
chapter_45	nay -PRON- may call -PRON- an ocean wide renown not only be -PRON- famous in life and now be immortal in forecastle story after death but -PRON- be admit into all the right privilege and distinction of a name have as much a name indeed as cambyses or caesar
chapter_45	be -PRON- not so o timor tom
chapter_45	thou famed leviathan scar like an iceberg who so long did'st lurk in the oriental strait of that name whose spout be oft see from the palmy beach of ombay
chapter_45	be -PRON- not so o new zealand jack
chapter_45	be -PRON- not so o morquan
chapter_45	king of japan whose lofty jet -PRON- say at time assume the semblance of a snow white cross against the sky
chapter_45	be -PRON- not so o don miguel
chapter_45	in plain prose here be four whale as well known to the student of cetacean history as marius or sylla to the classic scholar
chapter_45	but this be not all
chapter_45	-PRON- do not know where -PRON- can find a good place than just here to make mention of one or two other thing which to -PRON- seem important as in print form establish in all respect the reasonableness of the whole story of the white whale more especially the catastrophe
chapter_45	so ignorant be most landsman of some of the plain and most palpable wonder of the world that without some hint touch the plain fact historical and otherwise of the fishery -PRON- may scout at moby dick as a monstrous fable or still bad and more detestable a hideous and intolerable allegory
chapter_45	first though most man have some vague flit idea of the general peril of the grand fishery yet -PRON- have nothing like a fix vivid conception of those peril and the frequency with which -PRON- recur
chapter_45	one reason perhaps be that not one in fifty of the actual disaster and death by casualty in the fishery ever find a public record at home however transient and immediately forget that record
chapter_45	do -PRON- suppose that that poor fellow there who this moment perhaps catch by the whale line off the coast of new guinea be be carry down to the bottom of the sea by the sounding leviathan do -PRON- suppose that that poor fellow 's name will appear in the newspaper obituary -PRON- will read to morrow at -PRON- breakfast
chapter_45	no because the mail be very irregular between here and new guinea
chapter_45	in fact do -PRON- ever hear what may be call regular news direct or indirect from new guinea
chapter_45	not a gallon -PRON- burn but at least one drop of man 's blood be spill for -PRON-
chapter_45	secondly people ashore have indeed some indefinite idea that a whale be an enormous creature of enormous power but -PRON- have ever find that when narrate to -PRON- some specific example of this two fold enormousness -PRON- have significantly compliment -PRON- upon -PRON- facetiousness when -PRON- declare upon -PRON- soul -PRON- have no more idea of be facetious than moses when -PRON- write the history of the plague of egypt
chapter_45	but fortunately the special point -PRON- here seek can be establish upon testimony entirely independent of -PRON- own
chapter_45	that point be this the sperm whale be in some case sufficiently powerful know and judiciously malicious as with direct aforethought to stave in utterly destroy and sink a large ship and what be more the sperm whale have do -PRON-
chapter_45	first in the year 1820 the ship essex captain pollard of nantucket be cruise in the pacific ocean
chapter_45	one day -PRON- see spout lower -PRON- boat and give chase to a shoal of sperm whale
chapter_45	ere long several of the whale be wound when suddenly a very large whale escape from the boat issue from the shoal and bear directly down upon the ship
chapter_45	dash -PRON- forehead against -PRON- hull -PRON- so stove -PRON- in that in less than ten minute -PRON- settle down and fall over
chapter_45	not a survive plank of -PRON- have be see since
chapter_45	after the severe exposure part of the crew reach the land in -PRON- boat
chapter_45	be return home at last captain pollard once more sail for the pacific in command of another ship but the god shipwreck -PRON- again upon unknown rock and breaker for the second time -PRON- ship be utterly lose and forthwith forswear the sea -PRON- have never tempt -PRON- since
chapter_45	at this day captain pollard be a resident of nantucket
chapter_45	-PRON- have see owen chace who be chief mate of the essex at the time of the tragedy -PRON- have read -PRON- plain and faithful narrative -PRON- have converse with -PRON- son and all this within a few mile of the scene of the catastrophe
chapter_45	-PRON- aspect be most horrible and such as indicate resentment and fury
chapter_45	-PRON- come directly from the shoal which -PRON- have just before enter and in which -PRON- have strike three of -PRON- companion as if fire with revenge for -PRON- suffering
chapter_45	again at all event the whole circumstance take together all happen before -PRON- own eye and produce at the time impression in -PRON- mind of decide calculate mischief on the part of the whale many of which impression -PRON- can not now recall induce -PRON- to be satisfied that -PRON- be correct in -PRON- opinion
chapter_45	here be -PRON- reflection some time after quit the ship during a black night an open boat when almost despairing of reach any hospitable shore
chapter_45	in another place p
chapter_45	secondly the ship union also of nantucket be in the year 1807 totally lose off the azores by a similar onset but the authentic particular of this catastrophe -PRON- have never chance to encounter though from the whale hunter -PRON- have now and then hear casual allusion to -PRON-
chapter_45	thirdly some eighteen or twenty year ago commodore j--- then command an american sloop of war of the first class happen to be dining with a party of whaling captain on board a nantucket ship in the harbor of oahu sandwich islands
chapter_45	conversation turn upon whale the commodore be pleased to be sceptical touch the amazing strength ascribe to -PRON- by the professional gentleman present
chapter_45	-PRON- peremptorily deny for example that any whale could so smite -PRON- stout sloop of war as to because -PRON- to leak so much as a thimbleful
chapter_45	some week after the commodore set sail in this impregnable craft for valparaiso
chapter_45	but -PRON- be stop on the way by a portly sperm whale that beg a few moment confidential business with -PRON-
chapter_45	that business consist in fetch the commodore 's craft such a thwack that with all -PRON- pump go -PRON- make straight for the near port to heave down and repair
chapter_45	-PRON- be not superstitious but -PRON- consider the commodore 's interview with that whale as providential
chapter_45	be not saul of tarsus convert from unbelief by a similar fright
chapter_45	-PRON- tell -PRON- the sperm whale will stand no nonsense
chapter_45	langsdorff -PRON- must know by the way be attach to the russian admiral krusenstern 's famous discovery expedition in the beginning of the present century
chapter_45	captain langsdorff thus begin -PRON- seventeenth chapter
chapter_45	an uncommon large whale the body of which be large than the ship -PRON- lie almost at the surface of the water but be not perceive by any one on board till the moment when the ship which be in full sail be almost upon -PRON- so that -PRON- be impossible to prevent -PRON- striking against -PRON-
chapter_45	-PRON- be thus place in the most imminent danger as this gigantic creature set up -PRON- back raise the ship three foot at least out of the water
chapter_45	the mast reel and the sail fall altogether while -PRON- who be below all spring instantly upon the deck conclude that -PRON- have strike upon some rock instead of this -PRON- see the monster sail off with the utmost gravity and solemnity
chapter_45	captain d'wolf apply immediately to the pump to examine whether or not the vessel have receive any damage from the shock but -PRON- find that very happily -PRON- have escape entirely uninjured
chapter_45	now the captain d'wolf here allude to as command the ship in question be a new englander who after a long life of unusual adventure as a sea captain this day reside in the village of dorchester near boston
chapter_45	-PRON- have the honour of be a nephew of -PRON-
chapter_45	-PRON- have particularly question -PRON- concern this passage in langsdorff
chapter_45	-PRON- substantiate every word
chapter_45	in that up and down manly book of old fashioned adventure so full too of honest wonder the voyage of lionel wafer one of ancient dampier 's old chum
chapter_45	-PRON- find a little matter set down so like that just quote from langsdorff that -PRON- can not forbear insert -PRON- here for a corroborative example if such be need
chapter_45	in -PRON- way thither -PRON- say about four o'clock in the morning when -PRON- be about one hundred and fifty league from the main of america -PRON- ship feel a terrible shock which put -PRON- man in such consternation that -PRON- could hardly tell where -PRON- be or what to think but every one begin to prepare for death
chapter_45	and indeed the shock be so sudden and violent that -PRON- take -PRON- for grant the ship have strike against a rock but when the amazement be a little over -PRON- cast the lead and sound but find no ground
chapter_45	the suddenness of the shock make the gun leap in -PRON- carriage and several of the man be shake out of -PRON- hammock
chapter_45	lionel then go on to impute the shock to an earthquake and seem to substantiate the imputation by state that a great earthquake somewhere about that time do actually do great mischief along the spanish land
chapter_45	but -PRON- should not much wonder if in the darkness of that early hour of the morning the shock be after all cause by an unseen whale vertically bump the hull from beneath
chapter_45	-PRON- may proceed with several more example one way or another known to -PRON- of the great power and malice at time of the sperm whale
chapter_45	the english ship pusie hall can tell a story on that head and as for -PRON- strength let -PRON- say that there have be example where the line attach to a run sperm whale have in a calm be transfer to the ship and secure there the whale tow -PRON- great hull through the water as a horse walk off with a cart
chapter_45	again -PRON- be very often observe that if the sperm whale once strike be allow time to rally -PRON- then act not so often with blind rage as with wilful deliberate design of destruction to -PRON- pursuer nor be -PRON- without convey some eloquent indication of -PRON- character that upon be attack -PRON- will frequently open -PRON- mouth and retain -PRON- in that dread expansion for several consecutive minute
chapter_45	verily there be nothing new under the sun
chapter_45	as many know -PRON- write the history of -PRON- own time a work every way of uncommon value
chapter_45	but as -PRON- destroy ship as well as for other reason -PRON- must have be a whale and -PRON- be strongly inclined to think a sperm whale
chapter_45	and -PRON- will tell -PRON- why
chapter_45	for a long time -PRON- fancy that the sperm whale have be always unknown in the mediterranean and the deep water connect with -PRON-
chapter_45	-PRON- be tell on good authority that on the barbary coast a commodore davis of the british navy find the skeleton of a sperm whale
chapter_45	now as a vessel of war readily pass through the dardanelles hence a sperm whale could by the same route pass out of the mediterranean into the propontis
chapter_46	surmises
chapter_46	though consume with the hot fire of -PRON- purpose ahab in all -PRON- thought and action ever have in view the ultimate capture of moby dick though -PRON- seem ready to sacrifice all mortal interest to that one passion nevertheless -PRON- may have be that -PRON- be by nature and long habituation far too wedded to a fiery whaleman 's way altogether to abandon the collateral prosecution of the voyage
chapter_46	-PRON- would be refine too much perhaps even consider -PRON- monomania to hint that -PRON- vindictiveness towards the white whale may have possibly extend -PRON- in some degree to all sperm whale and that the more monster -PRON- slay by so much the more -PRON- multiply the chance that each subsequently encounter whale would prove to be the hat one -PRON- hunt
chapter_46	but if such an hypothesis be indeed exceptionable there be still additional consideration which though not so strictly accord with the wildness of -PRON- rule passion yet be by no mean incapable of sway -PRON-
chapter_46	-PRON- know for example that however magnetic -PRON- ascendency in some respect be over starbuck yet that ascendency do not cover the complete spiritual man any more than mere corporeal superiority involve intellectual mastership for to the purely spiritual the intellectual but stand in a sort of corporeal relation
chapter_46	starbuck 's body and starbuck 's coerce will be ahab 's so long as ahab keep -PRON- magnet at starbuck 's brain still -PRON- know that for all this the chief mate in -PRON- soul abhor -PRON- captain 's quest and could -PRON- would joyfully disintegrate -PRON- from -PRON- or even frustrate -PRON-
chapter_46	during that long interval starbuck would ever be apt to fall into open relapse of rebellion against -PRON- captain 's leadership unless some ordinary prudential circumstantial influence be bring to bear upon -PRON-
chapter_46	nor be ahab unmindful of another thing
chapter_46	grant that the white whale fully incite the heart of this -PRON- savage crew and play round -PRON- savageness even breed a certain generous knight errantism in -PRON- still while for the love of -PRON- -PRON- give chase to moby dick -PRON- must also have food for -PRON- more common daily appetite
chapter_46	for even the high lift and chivalric crusaders of old time be not content to traverse two thousand mile of land to fight for -PRON- holy sepulchre without commit burglary pick pocket and gain other pious perquisite by the way
chapter_46	have
chapter_46	-PRON- will not strip these man think ahab of all hope of cash aye cash
chapter_46	ahab
chapter_46	nor be there want still another precautionary motive more related to ahab personally
chapter_46	have impulsively -PRON- be probable and perhaps somewhat prematurely reveal the prime but private purpose of the pequod 's voyage ahab be now entirely conscious that in so do -PRON- have indirectly lay -PRON- open to the unanswerable charge of usurpation and with perfect impunity both moral and legal -PRON- crew if so disposed and to that end competent could refuse all further obedience to -PRON- and even violently wrest from -PRON- the command
chapter_46	that protection could only consist in -PRON- own predominate brain and heart and hand back by a heedful closely calculate attention to every minute atmospheric influence which -PRON- be possible for -PRON- crew to be subject to
chapter_46	for all these reason then and other perhaps too analytic to be verbally develop here ahab plainly see that -PRON- must still in a good degree continue true to the natural nominal purpose of the pequod 's voyage observe all customary usage and not only that but force -PRON- to evince all -PRON- well know passionate interest in the general pursuit of -PRON- profession
chapter_46	be all this as -PRON- may -PRON- voice be now often hear hail the three mast head and admonish -PRON- to keep a bright look out and not omit report even a porpoise
chapter_46	this vigilance be not long without reward
chapter_47	queequeg and -PRON- be mildly employ weave what be call a sword mat for an additional lashing to -PRON- boat
chapter_47	so still and subdue and yet somehow
chapter_47	prelude be all the scene and such an incantation of reverie lurk in the air that each silent sailor seem resolve into -PRON- own invisible self
chapter_47	-PRON- be the attendant or page of queequeg while busy at the mat
chapter_47	as -PRON- keep pass and repass the filling or woof of marline between the long yarn of the warp use -PRON- own hand for the shuttle and as queequeg stand sideways ever and anon slide -PRON- heavy oaken sword between the thread and idly look off upon the water carelessly and unthinkingly drive home every yarn -PRON- say so strange a dreaminess do there then reign all over the ship and all over the sea only break by the intermit dull sound of the sword that -PRON- seem as if this be the loom of time and -PRON- -PRON- be a shuttle mechanically weave and weave away at the fates
chapter_47	there lie the fix thread of the warp subject to but one single ever return unchanging vibration and that vibration merely enough to admit of the crosswise interblending of other thread with -PRON- own
chapter_47	this warp seem necessity and here think -PRON- with -PRON- own hand -PRON- ply -PRON- own shuttle and weave -PRON- own destiny into these unalterable thread
chapter_47	meantime queequeg 's impulsive indifferent sword sometimes hit the woof slantingly or crookedly or strongly or weakly as the case may be and by this difference in the conclude blow produce a correspond contrast in the final aspect of the complete fabric this savage 's sword think -PRON- which thus finally shape and fashion both warp and woof this easy indifferent sword must be chance aye chance free will and necessity nowise incompatible all interweavingly work together
chapter_47	the straight warp of necessity not to be swerve from -PRON- ultimate course -PRON- every alternate vibration indeed only tend to that free will still free to ply -PRON- shuttle between give thread and chance though restrained in -PRON- play within the right line of necessity and sideways in -PRON- motion direct by free will though thus prescribe to by both chance by turn rule either and have the last feature blow at event
chapter_47	thus -PRON- be weave and weave away when -PRON- start at a sound so strange long draw and musically wild and unearthly that the ball of free will drop from -PRON- hand and -PRON- stand gaze up at the cloud whence that voice drop like a wing
chapter_47	high aloft in the cross tree be that mad gay header tashtego
chapter_47	to be sure the same sound be that very moment perhaps be hear all over the sea from hundred of whaleman 's look out perch as high in the air but from few of those lung could that accustomed old cry have derive such a marvellous cadence as from tashtego the indian 's
chapter_47	as -PRON- stand hover over -PRON- half suspend in air so wildly and eagerly peer towards the horizon -PRON- would have think -PRON- some prophet or seer behold the shadow of fate and by those wild cry announce -PRON- come
chapter_47	-PRON- blow
chapter_47	-PRON- blow
chapter_47	
chapter_47	where away
chapter_47	a school of -PRON-
chapter_47	instantly all be commotion
chapter_47	and thereby whaleman distinguish this fish from other tribe of -PRON- genus
chapter_47	there go fluke
chapter_47	be now the cry from tashtego and the whale disappear
chapter_47	dough boy hurry below glance at the watch and report the exact minute to ahab
chapter_47	the ship be now keep away from the wind and -PRON- go gently rolling before -PRON-
chapter_47	for that singular craft at time evince by the sperm whale when sound with -PRON- head in one direction -PRON- nevertheless while conceal beneath the surface mill round and swiftly swim off in the opposite quarter this deceitfulness of -PRON- could not now be in action for there be no reason to suppose that the fish see by tashtego have be in any way alarm or indeed know at all of -PRON- vicinity
chapter_47	the sailor at the fore and mizzen have come down the line tub be fix in -PRON- place the crane be thrust out the mainyard be back and the three boat swing over the sea like three samphire basket over high cliff
chapter_47	outside of the bulwark -PRON- eager crew with one hand cling to the rail while one foot be expectantly poise on the gunwale
chapter_47	but at this critical instant a sudden exclamation be hear that take every eye from the whale
chapter_47	with a start all glare at dark ahab who be surround by five dusky phantom that seem fresh form out of air
chapter_48	the phantom for so -PRON- then seem be flit on the other side of the deck and with a noiseless celerity be cast loose the tackle and band of the boat which swing there
chapter_48	this boat have always be deem one of the spare boat though technically call the captain 's on account of -PRON- hanging from the starboard quarter
chapter_48	a rumpled chinese jacket of black cotton funereally invest -PRON- with wide black trowser of the same dark stuff
chapter_48	but strangely crown this ebonness be a glisten white plait turban the living hair braid and coiled round and round upon -PRON- head
chapter_48	less swart in aspect the companion of this figure be of that vivid tiger yellow complexion peculiar to some of the aboriginal native of the manillas a race notorious for a certain diabolism of subtilty and by some honest white mariner suppose to be the pay spy and secret confidential agent on the water of the devil -PRON- lord whose counting room -PRON- suppose to be elsewhere
chapter_48	
chapter_48	lower away then d'ye hear
chapter_48	shout across the deck
chapter_48	low away there -PRON- say
chapter_48	
chapter_48	but with all -PRON- eye again rivet upon the swart fedallah and -PRON- crew the inmate of the other boat obey not the command
chapter_48	captain ahab?-- say starbuck spread yourself cry ahab give way all four boat
chapter_48	thou flask pull out more to leeward
chapter_48	aye aye sir cheerily cry little king post sweep round -PRON- great steering oar
chapter_48	lie back address -PRON- crew
chapter_48	there!--there!--there again
chapter_48	
chapter_48	oh -PRON- do not mind'em sir say archy -PRON- know -PRON- all before now
chapter_48	do not -PRON- hear -PRON- in the hold
chapter_48	-PRON- be stowaway mr. flask
chapter_48	pull pull -PRON- fine heart alive pull -PRON- child pull -PRON- little one drawlingly and soothingly sigh stubb to -PRON- crew some of whom still show sign of uneasiness
chapter_48	what be -PRON- -PRON- stare at
chapter_48	those chap in yonder boat
chapter_48	tut
chapter_48	so so there -PRON- be now that be the stroke for a thousand pound that be the stroke to sweep the stake
chapter_48	hurrah for the gold cup of sperm oil -PRON- hero
chapter_48	three cheer man all heart alive
chapter_48	easy easy do not be in a hurry
chapter_48	don't be in a hurry
chapter_48	why do not -PRON- snap -PRON- oar -PRON- rascal
chapter_48	bite something -PRON- dog
chapter_48	so so so then softly softly
chapter_48	that be -PRON-
chapter_48	give way there give way
chapter_48	pull will ye
chapter_48	pull can not ye
chapter_48	why in the name of gudgeon and ginger cake do not ye pull pull and break something
chapter_48	pull and start -PRON- eye out
chapter_48	that be -PRON- that be -PRON-
chapter_48	now ye do something that look like -PRON- -PRON- steel bit
chapter_48	start -PRON-
chapter_48	start -PRON- -PRON- silver spoon
chapter_48	start -PRON- marling spike
chapter_48	but -PRON- must not suppose from this specimen of -PRON- sermonizing that -PRON- ever fly into downright passion with -PRON- congregation
chapter_48	not at all and therein consist -PRON- chief peculiarity
chapter_48	then again stubb be one of those odd sort of humorist whose jollity be sometimes so curiously ambiguous as to put all inferior on -PRON- guard in the matter of obey -PRON-
chapter_48	in obedience to a sign from ahab starbuck be now pull obliquely across stubb 's bow and when for a minute or so the two boat be pretty near to each other stubb hail the mate mr. starbuck
chapter_48	larboard boat there ahoy
chapter_48	a word with ye sir if ye please
chapter_48	halloa return starbuck turn round not a single inch as -PRON- speak still earnestly but whisperingly urge -PRON- crew -PRON- face set like a flint from stubb 's
chapter_48	what think ye of those yellow boy sir
chapter_48	strong strong boy
chapter_48	seethe -PRON- seethe -PRON- -PRON- lad
chapter_48	but never mind mr. stubb all for the good
chapter_48	let all -PRON- crew pull strong come what will
chapter_48	spring -PRON- man spring
chapter_48	there be hogshead of sperm ahead mr. stubb and that be what ye come for
chapter_48	pull -PRON- boy
chapter_48	sperm sperm be the play
chapter_48	
chapter_48	aye aye -PRON- think as much soliloquize stubb when the boat diverge as soon as -PRON- clapt eye on -PRON- -PRON- think so
chapter_48	-PRON- be hide down there
chapter_48	well well so be -PRON-
chapter_48	all right
chapter_48	give way man
chapter_48	-PRON- be not the white whale to day
chapter_48	give way
chapter_48	for -PRON- -PRON- silently recall the mysterious shadow -PRON- have see creep on board the pequod during the dim nantucket dawn as well as the enigmatical hinting of the unaccountable elijah
chapter_48	meantime ahab out of hearing of -PRON- officer have side the furthest to windward be still range ahead of the other boat a circumstance bespeak how potent a crew be pull -PRON-
chapter_48	those tiger yellow creature of -PRON- seem all steel and whalebone like five trip hammer -PRON- rise and fall with regular stroke of strength which periodically start the boat along the water like a horizontal burst boiler out of a mississippi steamer
chapter_48	as for fedallah who be see pull the harpooneer oar -PRON- have throw aside -PRON- black jacket and display -PRON- naked chest with the whole part of -PRON- body above the gunwale clearly cut against the alternate depression of the watery horizon while at the other end of the boat ahab with one arm like a fencer 's throw half backward into the air as if to counterbalance any tendency to trip ahab be see steadily manage -PRON- steering oar as in a thousand boat lowering ere the white whale have tear -PRON-
chapter_48	all at once the outstretched arm give a peculiar motion and then remain fix while the boat 's five oar be see simultaneously peak
chapter_48	instantly the three spread boat in the rear pause on -PRON- way
chapter_48	the whale have irregularly settle bodily down into the blue thus give no distantly discernible token of the movement though from -PRON- close vicinity ahab have observe -PRON-
chapter_48	thou queequeg stand up
chapter_48	nimbly spring up on the triangular raise box in the bow the savage stand erect there and with intensely eager eye gaze off towards the spot where the chase have last be descry
chapter_48	not very far distant flask 's boat be also lie breathlessly still -PRON- commander recklessly stand upon the top of the loggerhead a stout sort of post root in the keel and rise some two foot above the level of the stern platform
chapter_48	-PRON- be use for catch turn with the whale line
chapter_48	-PRON- top be not more spacious than the palm of a man 's hand and stand upon such a base as that flask seem perch at the mast head of some ship which have sink to all but -PRON- truck
chapter_48	but little king post be small and short and at the same time little king post be full of a large and tall ambition so that this loggerhead stand point of -PRON- do by no mean satisfy king post
chapter_48	-PRON- can not see three sea off tip -PRON- up an oar there and let -PRON- on to that
chapter_48	upon this daggoo with either hand upon the gunwale to steady -PRON- way swiftly slide aft and then erect -PRON- volunteer -PRON- lofty shoulder for a pedestal
chapter_48	and here be flask now stand
chapter_48	daggoo with one lift arm furnish -PRON- with a breastband to lean against and steady -PRON- by
chapter_48	-PRON- giddily perch upon the loggerhead -PRON- under such circumstance
chapter_48	but the sight of little flask mount upon gigantic daggoo be yet more curious for sustain -PRON- with a cool indifferent easy unthought of barbaric majesty the noble negro to every roll of the sea harmoniously roll -PRON- fine form
chapter_48	on -PRON- broad back flaxen haired flask seem a snow flake
chapter_48	the bearer look noble than the rider
chapter_48	though truly vivacious tumultuous ostentatious little flask would now and then stamp with impatience but not one add heave do -PRON- thereby give to the negro 's lordly chest
chapter_48	so have -PRON- see passion and vanity stamp the live magnanimous earth but the earth do not alter -PRON- tide and -PRON- season for that
chapter_48	the whale may have make one of -PRON- regular sounding not a temporary dive from mere fright and if that be the case stubb as -PRON- will not in such case -PRON- seem be resolve to solace the languishing interval with -PRON- pipe
chapter_48	-PRON- load -PRON- and ram home the loading with -PRON- thumb end but hardly have -PRON- ignite -PRON- match across the rough sandpaper of -PRON- hand when tashtego -PRON- harpooneer whose eye have be set to windward like two fix star suddenly drop like light from -PRON- erect attitude to -PRON- seat cry out in a quick phrensy of hurry
chapter_48	to a landsman no whale nor any sign of a herring would have be visible at that moment nothing but a troubled bit of greenish white water and thin scattered puff of vapour hover over -PRON- and suffusingly blow off to leeward like the confused scud from white rolling billow
chapter_48	the air around suddenly vibrate and tingle as -PRON- be like the air over intensely heated plate of iron
chapter_48	beneath this atmospheric wave and curling and partially beneath a thin layer of water also the whale be swim
chapter_48	see in advance of all the other indication the puff of vapour -PRON- spout seem -PRON- forerun courier and detached flying outrider
chapter_48	all four boat be now in keen pursuit of that one spot of troubled water and air
chapter_48	-PRON- do not say much to -PRON- crew though nor do -PRON- crew say anything to -PRON-
chapter_48	only the silence of the boat be at interval startlingly pierce by one of -PRON- peculiar whisper now harsh with command now soft with entreaty
chapter_48	how different the loud little king post
chapter_48	beach -PRON- beach -PRON- on -PRON- black back boy only do that for -PRON- and -PRON- will sign over to -PRON- -PRON- martha 's vineyard plantation boy include wife and child boy
chapter_48	but -PRON- shall go stark star mad
chapter_48	see see that white water
chapter_48	"look at that chap now philosophically drawl stubb who with -PRON- unlighted short pipe mechanically retain between -PRON- tooth at a short distance follow after--""he 's get fit that flask have"
chapter_48	fit
chapter_48	merrily merrily heart alive
chapter_48	pudding for supper -PRON- know merry be the word
chapter_48	pull babe pull suckling pull all
chapter_48	softly softly and steadily -PRON- man
chapter_48	take -PRON- easy why do not ye take -PRON- easy -PRON- say and burst all -PRON- liver and lung
chapter_48	but what -PRON- be that inscrutable ahab say to that tiger yellow crew of -PRON- these be word best omit here for -PRON- live under the bless light of the evangelical land
chapter_48	only the infidel shark in the audacious sea may give ear to such word when with tornado brow and eye of red murder and foam glue lip ahab leap after -PRON- prey
chapter_48	meanwhile all the boat tear on
chapter_48	but this be against all rule for the oarsman must put out -PRON- eye and ram a skewer through -PRON- neck usage pronounce that -PRON- must have no organ but ear and no limb but arm in these critical moment
chapter_48	-PRON- be a sight full of quick wonder and awe
chapter_48	the vast swell of the omnipotent sea the surging hollow roar -PRON- make as -PRON- roll along the eight gunwale like gigantic bowl in a boundless bowling green the brief suspend agony of the boat as -PRON- would tip for an instant on the knife like edge of the sharp wave that almost seem threaten to cut -PRON- in two the sudden profound dip into the watery glen and hollow the keen spurring and goading to gain the top of the opposite hill the headlong sl like slide down -PRON- other side all these with the cry of the headsmen and harpooneer and the shudder gasp of the oarsman with the wondrous sight of the ivory pequod bear down upon -PRON- boat with outstretched sail like a wild hen after -PRON- scream brood all this be thrilling
chapter_48	not the raw recruit march from the bosom of -PRON- wife into the fever heat of -PRON- first battle not the dead man 's ghost encounter the first unknown phantom in the other world neither of these can feel strange and strong emotion than that man do who for the first time find -PRON- pull into the charmed churn circle of the hunt sperm whale
chapter_48	the dancing white water make by the chase be now become more and more visible owe to the increase darkness of the dun cloud shadow fling upon the sea
chapter_48	the jet of vapour no longer blended but tilt everywhere to right and leave the whale seem separate -PRON- wake
chapter_48	the boat be pull more apart starbuck give chase to three whale run dead to leeward
chapter_48	there be white water again!--close to
chapter_48	spring
chapter_48	soon after two cry in quick succession on each side of -PRON- denote that the other boat have get fast but hardly be -PRON- overhear when with a lightning like hurtle whisper starbuck say stand up
chapter_48	though not one of the oarsman be then face the life and death peril so close to -PRON- ahead yet with -PRON- eye on the intense countenance of the mate in the stern of the boat -PRON- know that the imminent instant have come -PRON- hear too an enormous wallowing sound as of fifty elephant stir in -PRON- litter
chapter_48	meanwhile the boat be still boom through the mist the wave curl and hiss around -PRON- like the erect crest of enraged serpent
chapter_48	that be -PRON- hump
chapter_48	there there give -PRON- to -PRON-
chapter_48	whisper starbuck
chapter_48	then all in one weld commotion come an invisible push from astern while forward the boat seem strike on a ledge the sail collapse and explode a gush of scalding vapour shoot up near by something roll and tumble like an earthquake beneath -PRON-
chapter_48	the whole crew be half suffocate as -PRON- be toss helter skelter into the white curdling cream of the squall
chapter_48	squall whale and harpoon have all blend together and the whale merely graze by the iron escape
chapter_48	though completely swamp the boat be nearly unharmed
chapter_48	swimming round -PRON-
chapter_48	-PRON- pick up the float oar and lash -PRON- across the gunwale tumble back to -PRON- place
chapter_48	there -PRON- sit up to -PRON- knee in the sea the water cover every rib and plank so that to -PRON- downward gaze eye the suspend craft seem a coral boat grow up to -PRON- from the bottom of the ocean
chapter_48	the oar be useless as propeller perform now the office of life preserver
chapter_48	so cut the lashing of the waterproof match keg after many failure starbuck contrive to ignite the lamp in the lantern then stretch -PRON- on a waif pole hand -PRON- to queequeg as the standard bearer of this forlorn hope
chapter_48	there then -PRON- sit hold up that imbecile candle in the heart of that almighty forlornness
chapter_48	there then -PRON- sit the sign and symbol of a man without faith hopelessly hold up hope in the midst of despair
chapter_48	wet drench through and shiver cold despairing of ship or boat -PRON- lift up -PRON- eye as the dawn come on
chapter_48	the mist still spread over the sea the empty lantern lie crush in the bottom of the boat
chapter_48	the sound come nearer and nearer the thick mist be dimly part by a huge vague form
chapter_48	affrighted -PRON- all spring into the sea as the ship at last loom into view bear right down upon -PRON- within a distance of not much more than -PRON- length
chapter_48	again -PRON- swim for -PRON- be dash against -PRON- by the sea and be at last take up and safely land on board
chapter_48	ere the squall come close to the other boat have cut loose from -PRON- fish and return to the ship in good time
chapter_48	the ship have give -PRON- up but be still cruise if haply -PRON- may light upon some token of -PRON- perish an oar or a lance pole
chapter_49	however nothing dispirit and nothing seem worth while dispute
chapter_49	-PRON- bolt down all event all creed and belief and persuasion all hard thing visible and invisible never mind how knobby as an ostrich of potent digestion gobble down bullet and gun flint
chapter_49	that odd sort of wayward mood -PRON- be speak of come over a man only in some time of extreme tribulation -PRON- come in the very midst of -PRON- earnestness so that what just before may have seem to -PRON- a thing most momentous now seem but a part of the general joke
chapter_49	queequeg say -PRON- when -PRON- have drag -PRON- the last man to the deck and -PRON- be still shake -PRON- in -PRON- jacket to fling off the water queequeg -PRON- fine friend do this sort of thing often happen
chapter_49	without much emotion though soak through just like -PRON- -PRON- give -PRON- to understand that such thing do often happen
chapter_49	mr. stubb say -PRON- turn to that worthy who button up in -PRON- oil jacket be now calmly smoke -PRON- pipe in the rain mr. stubb -PRON- think -PRON- have hear -PRON- say that of all whaleman -PRON- ever meet -PRON- chief mate mr. starbuck be by far the most careful and prudent
chapter_49	-PRON- suppose then that go plump on a fly whale with -PRON- sail set in a foggy squall be the height of a whaleman 's discretion
chapter_49	
chapter_49	certain
chapter_49	-PRON- have lower for whale from a leak ship in a gale off cape horn
chapter_49	mr. flask say -PRON- turn to little king post who be stand close by -PRON- be experience in these thing and -PRON- be not
chapter_49	yes that be the law
chapter_49	ha ha
chapter_49	the whale would give -PRON- squint for squint mind that
chapter_49	
chapter_49	considering therefore that squall and capsizing in the water and consequent bivouack on the deep be matter of common occurrence in this kind of life consider that at the superlatively critical instant of go on to the whale -PRON- must resign -PRON- life into the hand of -PRON- who steer the boat oftentimes a fellow who at that very moment be in -PRON- impetuousness upon the point of scuttle the craft with -PRON- own frantic stamping consider that the particular disaster to -PRON- own particular boat be chiefly to be impute to starbuck 's drive on to -PRON- whale almost in the tooth of a squall and consider that starbuck notwithstanding be famous for -PRON- great heedfulness in the fishery consider that -PRON- belong to this uncommonly prudent starbuck 's boat and finally consider in what a devil 's chase -PRON- be implicate touch the white whale take all thing together -PRON- say -PRON- think -PRON- may as well go below and make a rough draft of -PRON- will
chapter_49	queequeg say -PRON- come along -PRON- shall be -PRON- lawyer executor and legatee
chapter_49	
chapter_49	-PRON- may seem strange that of all man sailor should be tinker at -PRON- last will and testament but there be no people in the world more fond of that diversion
chapter_49	this be the fourth time in -PRON- nautical life that -PRON- have do the same thing
chapter_49	after the ceremony be conclude upon the present occasion -PRON- feel all the easy a stone be roll away from -PRON- heart
chapter_49	besides all the day -PRON- should now live would be as good as the day that lazarus live after -PRON- resurrection a supplementary clean gain of so many month or week as the case may be
chapter_49	-PRON- look round -PRON- tranquilly and contentedly like a quiet ghost with a clean conscience sit inside the bar of a snug family vault
chapter_49	now then think -PRON- unconsciously roll up the sleeve of -PRON- frock here go for a cool collect dive at death and destruction and the devil fetch the hindmost
chapter_50	ahab 's boat and crew
chapter_50	fedallah
chapter_50	who would have think -PRON- flask cry stubb if -PRON- have but one leg -PRON- would not catch -PRON- in a boat unless maybe to stop the plug hole with -PRON- timber toe
chapter_50	oh
chapter_50	-PRON- be a wonderful old man
chapter_50	-PRON- do not think -PRON- so strange after all on that account say flask
chapter_50	that would disable -PRON- but -PRON- have one knee and good part of the other left -PRON- know
chapter_50	
chapter_50	-PRON- do not know that -PRON- little man -PRON- never yet see -PRON- kneel
chapter_50	among whale wise people -PRON- have often be argue whether consider the paramount importance of -PRON- life to the success of the voyage -PRON- be right for a whaling captain to jeopardize that life in the active peril of the chase
chapter_50	so tamerlane 's soldier often argue with tear in -PRON- eye whether that invaluable life of -PRON- ought to be carry into the thick of the fight
chapter_50	but with ahab the question assume a modify aspect
chapter_50	consider that with two leg man be but a hobble wight in all time of danger consider that the pursuit of whale be always under great and extraordinary difficulty that every individual moment indeed then comprise a peril under these circumstance be -PRON- wise for any maimed man to enter a whale boat in the hunt
chapter_50	as a general thing the joint owner of the pequod must have plainly think not
chapter_50	therefore -PRON- have not solicit a boat 's crew from -PRON- nor have -PRON- in any way hint -PRON- desire on that head
chapter_50	nevertheless -PRON- have take private measure of -PRON- own touch all that matter
chapter_50	until cabaco 's publish discovery the sailor have little foresee -PRON- though to be sure when after be a little while out of port all hand have conclude the customary business of fit the whaleboat for service when some time after this ahab be now and then find bestir -PRON- in the matter of make thole pin with -PRON- own hand for what be think to be one of the spare boat and even solicitously cut the small wooden skewer which when the line be run out be pin over the groove in the bow when all this be observe in -PRON- and particularly -PRON- solicitude in have an extra coat of sheathe in the bottom of the boat as if to make -PRON- better withstand the pointed pressure of -PRON- ivory limb and also the anxiety -PRON- evince in exactly shape the thigh board or clumsy cleat as -PRON- be sometimes call the horizontal piece in the boat 's bow for brace the knee against in dart or stab at the whale when -PRON- be observe how often -PRON- stand up in that boat with -PRON- solitary knee fix in the semi circular depression in the cleat and with the carpenter 's chisel gouge out a little here and straighten -PRON- a little there all these thing -PRON- say have awaken much interest and curiosity at the time
chapter_50	but almost everybody suppose that this particular preparative heedfulness in ahab must only be with a view to the ultimate chase of moby dick for -PRON- have already reveal -PRON- intention to hunt that mortal monster in person
chapter_50	but such a supposition do by no mean involve the remote suspicion as to any boat 's crew be assign to that boat
chapter_50	now with the subordinate phantom what wonder remain soon wan away for in a whaler wonder soon wane
chapter_50	besides now and then such unaccountable odd and end of strange nation come up from the unknown nook and ash hole of the earth to man these float outlaw of whaler and the ship -PRON- often pick up such queer castaway creature find toss about the open sea on plank bit of wreck oar whaleboat canoe blow off japanese junk and what not that beelzebub -PRON- may climb up the side and step down into the cabin to chat with the captain and -PRON- would not create any unsubduable excitement in the forecastle
chapter_50	but be all this as -PRON- may certain -PRON- be that while the subordinate phantom soon find -PRON- place among the crew though still as -PRON- be somehow distinct from -PRON- yet that hair turbaned fedallah remain a muffled mystery to the last
chapter_50	whence -PRON- come in a mannerly world like this by what sort of unaccountable tie -PRON- soon evince -PRON- to be link with ahab 's peculiar fortune nay so far as to have some sort of a half hint influence heaven know but -PRON- may have be even authority over -PRON- all this none know
chapter_50	but one can not sustain an indifferent air concern fedallah
chapter_50	-PRON- be such a creature as civilized domestic people in the temperate zone only see in -PRON- dream and that but dimly but the like of whom now and then glide among the unchanging asiatic community especially the oriental isle to the east of the continent those insulate immemorial unalterable country which even in these modern day still preserve much of the ghostly aboriginalness of earth 's primal generation when the memory of the first man be a distinct recollection and all man -PRON- descendant unknowing whence -PRON- come eyed each other as real phantom and ask of the sun and the moon why -PRON- be create and to what end when though accord to genesis the angel indeed consort with the daughter of man the devil also add the uncanonical rabbins indulge in mundane amour
chapter_51	the spirit spout days week pass and under easy sail the ivory pequod have slowly sweep across four several cruising ground that off the azores off the cape de verdes on the plate so call be off the mouth of the rio de la plata and the carrol ground an unstaked watery locality southerly from st. helena
chapter_51	-PRON- be while glide through these latter water that one serene and moonlight night when all the wave roll by like scroll of silver and by -PRON- soft suffuse seething make what seem a silvery silence not a solitude on such a silent night a silvery jet be see far in advance of the white bubble at the bow
chapter_51	light up by the moon -PRON- look celestial seem some plumed and glitter god uprising from the sea
chapter_51	fedallah first descry this jet
chapter_51	-PRON- may think with what emotion then the seaman behold this old oriental perch aloft at such unusual hour -PRON- turban and the moon companion in one sky
chapter_51	but when after spend -PRON- uniform interval there for several successive night without utter a single sound when after all this silence -PRON- unearthly voice be hear announce that silvery moon light jet every recline mariner start to -PRON- foot as if some winged spirit have light in the rigging and hail the mortal crew
chapter_51	walk the deck with quick side lunge stride ahab command the t'gallant sail and royal to be set and every stunsail spread
chapter_51	while -PRON- one live leg make lively echo along the deck every stroke of -PRON- dead limb sound like a coffin tap
chapter_51	on life and death this old man walk
chapter_51	but though the ship so swiftly speed and though from every eye like arrow the eager glance shoot yet the silvery jet be no more see that night
chapter_51	every sailor swear -PRON- see -PRON- once but not a second time
chapter_51	this midnight spout have almost grow a forget thing when some day after lo
chapter_51	at the same silent hour -PRON- be again announce again -PRON- be descry by all but upon make sail to overtake -PRON- once more -PRON- disappear as if -PRON- have never be
chapter_51	mysteriously jet into the clear moonlight or starlight as the case may be disappear again for one whole day or two day or three and somehow seem at every distinct repetition to be advance still further and further in -PRON- van this solitary jet seem for ever allure -PRON- on
chapter_51	for a time there reign too a sense of peculiar dread at this flit apparition as if -PRON- be treacherously beckon -PRON- on and on in order that the monster may turn round upon -PRON- and rend -PRON- at last in the remote and most savage sea
chapter_51	but at last when turn to the eastward the cape wind begin howl around -PRON- and -PRON- rise and fall upon the long troubled sea that be there when the ivory tusked pequod sharply bow to the blast and gore the dark wave in -PRON- madness till like shower of silver chip the foam flake fly over -PRON- bulwark then all this desolate vacuity of life go away but give place to sight more dismal than before
chapter_51	close to -PRON- bow strange form in the water dart hither and thither before -PRON- while thick in -PRON- rear fly the inscrutable sea raven
chapter_51	and every morning perch on -PRON- stay row of these bird be see and spite of -PRON- hooting for a long time obstinately cling to the hemp as though -PRON- deem -PRON- ship some drift uninhabited craft a thing appoint to desolation and therefore fit roost place for -PRON- homeless self
chapter_51	and heave and heave still unrestingly heave the black sea as if -PRON- vast tide be a conscience and the great mundane soul be in anguish and remorse for the long sin and suffer -PRON- have breed
chapter_51	rather cape tormentoto as call of yore for long allure by the perfidious silence that before have attend -PRON- -PRON- find -PRON- launch into this tormented sea where guilty being transform into those fowl and these fish seem condemn to swim on everlastingly without any haven in store or beat that black air without any horizon
chapter_51	but calm snow white and unvarying still direct -PRON- fountain of feather to the sky still beckon -PRON- on from before the solitary jet would at time be descry
chapter_51	during all this blackness of the element ahab though assume for the time the almost continual command of the drenched and dangerous deck manifest the gloomy reserve and more seldom than ever address -PRON- mate
chapter_51	then captain and crew become practical fatalist
chapter_51	so with -PRON- ivory leg insert into -PRON- accustomed hole and with one hand firmly grasp a shroud ahab for hour and hour would stand gaze dead to windward while an occasional squall of sleet or snow would all but congeal -PRON- very eyelash together
chapter_51	meantime the crew drive from the forward part of the ship by the perilous sea that burstingly break over -PRON- bow stand in a line along the bulwark in the waist and the good to guard against the leap wave each man have slip -PRON- into a sort of bowline secure to the rail in which -PRON- swing as in a loosen belt
chapter_51	though the body be erect the head be throw back so that the closed eye be point towards the needle of the tell tale that swing from a beam in the ceiling
chapter_51	terrible old man think starbuck with a shudder sleep in this gale still thou steadfastly eyest thy purpose
chapter_52	the albatross
chapter_52	south eastward from the cape off the distant crozetts a good cruising ground for right whalemen a sail loom ahead the goney albatross by name
chapter_52	as -PRON- slowly draw nigh from -PRON- lofty perch at the fore mast head -PRON- have a good view of that sight so remarkable to a tyro in the far ocean fishery a whaler at sea and long absent from home
chapter_52	all down -PRON- side this spectral appearance be trace with long channel of reddened rust while all -PRON- spar and -PRON- rigging be like the thick branch of tree fur over with hoar frost
chapter_52	-PRON- seem clothe in the skin of beast so torn and bepatch the raiment that have survive nearly four year of cruising
chapter_52	stand in iron hoop nail to the mast -PRON- sway and swing over a fathomless sea and though when the ship slowly glide close under -PRON- stern -PRON- six man in the air come so nigh to each other that -PRON- may almost have leap from the mast head of one ship to those of the other yet those forlorn look fisherman mildly eye -PRON- as -PRON- pass say not one word to -PRON- own look out while the quarter deck hail be be hear from below
chapter_52	ship ahoy
chapter_52	
chapter_52	but as the strange captain lean over the pallid bulwark be in the act of put -PRON- trumpet to -PRON- mouth -PRON- somehow fall from -PRON- hand into the sea and the wind now rise amain -PRON- in vain strove to make -PRON- hear without -PRON-
chapter_52	meantime -PRON- ship be still increase the distance between
chapter_52	while in various silent way the seaman of the pequod be evince -PRON- observance of this ominous incident at the first mere mention of the white whale 's name to another ship ahab for a moment pause -PRON- almost seem as though -PRON- would have lower a boat to board the stranger have not the threaten wind forbid
chapter_52	"but take advantage of -PRON- windward position -PRON- again seize -PRON- trumpet and know by -PRON- aspect that the strange vessel be a nantucketer and shortly bind home -PRON- loudly hailed--""ahoy there"
chapter_52	this be the pequod bind round the world
chapter_52	tell -PRON- to address all future letter to the pacific ocean
chapter_52	at that moment the two wake be fairly cross and instantly then in accordance with -PRON- singular way shoal of small harmless fish that for some day before have be placidly swimming by -PRON- side dart away with what seem shudder fin and range -PRON- fore and aft with the stranger 's flank
chapter_52	swim away from -PRON- do ye
chapter_52	murmur ahab gaze over into the water
chapter_52	there seem but little in the word but the tone convey more of deep helpless sadness than the insane old man have ever before evince
chapter_52	"but turn to the steersman who thus far have be hold the ship in the wind to diminish -PRON- headway -PRON- cry out in -PRON- old lion voice,--""up helm"
chapter_52	round the world
chapter_52	there be much in that sound to inspire proud feeling but whereto do all that circumnavigation conduct
chapter_52	only through numberless peril to the very point whence -PRON- start where those that -PRON- leave behind secure be all the time before -PRON- be this world an endless plain and by sail eastward -PRON- could for ever reach new distance and discover sight more sweet and strange than any cyclades or islands of king solomon then there be promise in the voyage
chapter_52	but in pursuit of those far mystery -PRON- dream of or in tormented chase of that demon phantom that some time or other swim before all human heart while chase such over this round globe -PRON- either lead -PRON- on in barren maze or midway leave -PRON- whelmed
chapter_53	the ostensible reason why ahab do not go on board of the whaler -PRON- have speak be this the wind and sea betoken storm
chapter_53	for as -PRON- eventually turn out -PRON- care not to consort even for five minute with any strange captain except -PRON- could contribute some of that information -PRON- so absorbingly seek
chapter_53	but all this may remain inadequately estimate be not something say here of the peculiar usage of whaling vessel when meet each other in foreign sea and especially on a common cruising ground
chapter_53	if two stranger cross the pine barrens in new york state or the equally desolate salisbury plain in england if casually encounter each other in such inhospitable wild these twain for the life of -PRON- can not well avoid a mutual salutation and stop for a moment to interchange the news and perhaps sit down for a while and rest in concert then how much more natural that upon the illimitable pine barrens and salisbury plains of the sea two whaling vessel descry each other at the end of the earth off lone fanning 's island or the far away king 's mills how much more natural -PRON- say that under such circumstance these ship should not only interchange hail but come into still close more friendly and sociable contact
chapter_53	and especially would this seem to be a matter of course in the case of vessel own in one seaport and whose captain officer and not a few of the man be personally know to each other and consequently have all sort of dear domestic thing to talk about
chapter_53	for the long absent ship the outward bounder perhaps have letter on board at any rate -PRON- will be sure to let -PRON- have some paper of a date a year or two later than the last one on -PRON- blurred and thumb wear file
chapter_53	and in return for that courtesy the outward bind ship would receive the late whaling intelligence from the cruising ground to which -PRON- may be destine a thing of the utmost importance to -PRON-
chapter_53	and in degree all this will hold true concern whaling vessel cross each other 's track on the cruising ground -PRON- even though -PRON- be equally long absent from home
chapter_53	for one of -PRON- may have receive a transfer of letter from some third and now far remote vessel and some of those letter may be for the people of the ship -PRON- now meet
chapter_53	nor would difference of country make any very essential difference that be so long as both party speak one language as be the case with americans and english
chapter_53	though to be sure from the small number of english whaler such meeting do not very often occur and when -PRON- do occur there be too apt to be a sort of shyness between -PRON- for -PRON- englishman be rather reserve and -PRON- yankee -PRON- do not fancy that sort of thing in anybody but -PRON-
chapter_53	so then -PRON- see that of all ship separately sail the sea the whaler have most reason to be sociable and -PRON- be so
chapter_53	"and as for pirates when -PRON- chance to cross each other 's cross bone the first hail is--""how many skull"
chapter_53	"the same way that whaler hail--""how many barrel"
chapter_53	and that question once answer pirate straightway steer apart for -PRON- be infernal villain on both side and do not like to see overmuch of each other 's villanous likeness
chapter_53	but look at the godly honest unostentatious hospitable sociable free and easy whaler
chapter_53	-PRON- have a gam a thing so utterly unknown to all other ship that -PRON- never hear of the name even and if by chance -PRON- should hear of -PRON- -PRON- only grin at -PRON- and repeat gamesome stuff about spouter and blubber boiler and such like pretty exclamation
chapter_53	why -PRON- be that all merchant seaman and also all pirates and man of war 's man and slave ship sailor cherish such a scornful feeling towards whale ship this be a question -PRON- would be hard to answer
chapter_53	-PRON- sometimes end in uncommon elevation indeed but only at the gallow
chapter_53	and besides when a man be elevate in that odd fashion -PRON- have no proper foundation for -PRON- superior altitude
chapter_53	hence -PRON- conclude that in boast -PRON- to be high lift above a whaleman in that assertion the pirate have no solid basis to stand on
chapter_53	but what be a gam
chapter_53	nevertheless this same expressive word have now for many year be in constant use among some fifteen thousand true bear yankees
chapter_53	certainly -PRON- need a definition and should be incorporate into the lexicon
chapter_53	with that view let -PRON- learnedly define -PRON-
chapter_53	gam
chapter_53	noun
chapter_53	a social meeting of two or more whaleship
chapter_53	generally on a cruising ground
chapter_53	when
chapter_53	after exchange hails
chapter_53	they exchange visit by boat crew
chapter_53	there be another little item about gamming which must not be forget here
chapter_53	all profession have -PRON- own little peculiarity of detail so have the whale fishery
chapter_53	in a pirate man of war or slave ship when the captain be row anywhere in -PRON- boat -PRON- always sit in the stern sheet on a comfortable sometimes cushion seat there and often steer -PRON- with a pretty little milliner 's tiller decorate with gay cord and ribbon
chapter_53	high time indeed if whaling captain be wheel about the water on castor like gouty old alderman in patent chair
chapter_53	and as for a tiller the whale boat never admit of any such effeminacy and therefore as in gam a complete boat 's crew must leave the ship and hence as the boat steerer or harpooneer be of the number that subordinate be the steersman upon the occasion and the captain have no place to sit in be pull off to -PRON- visit all stand like a pine tree
chapter_53	merely make a spread angle of two pole and -PRON- can not stand -PRON- up
chapter_53	then again -PRON- would never do in plain sight of the world 's rivet eye -PRON- would never do -PRON- say for this straddle captain to be see steady -PRON- the slight particle by catch hold of anything with -PRON- hand indeed as token of -PRON- entire buoyant self command -PRON- generally carry -PRON- hand in -PRON- trowser pocket but perhaps be generally very large heavy hand -PRON- carry -PRON- there for ballast
chapter_54	the town ho 's story
chapter_54	as told
chapter_54	at the golden inn
chapter_54	the cape of good hope and all the watery region round about there be much like some note four corner of a great highway where -PRON- meet more traveller than in any other part
chapter_54	-PRON- be not very long after speak the goney that another homeward bind whaleman the town ho be encounter
chapter_54	for that secret part of the story be unknown to the captain of the town ho -PRON-
chapter_54	-PRON- be the private property of three confederate white seaman of that ship one of whom -PRON- seem communicate -PRON- to tashtego with romish injunction of secrecy but the following night tashtego ramble in -PRON- sleep and reveal so much of -PRON- in that way that when -PRON- be waken -PRON- could not well withhold the rest
chapter_54	interweave in -PRON- proper place this dark thread with the story as publicly narrate on the ship the whole of this strange affair -PRON- now proceed to put on lasting record

chapter_54	of those fine cavalier the young dons pedro and sebastian be on the close term with -PRON- and hence the interlude question -PRON- occasionally put and which be duly answer at the time
chapter_54	-PRON- be somewhere to the northward of the line
chapter_54	though no small passage be before -PRON- yet if the common chance favour -PRON- do not at all fear that -PRON- ship would founder by the way because -PRON- pump be of the good and be periodically relieved at -PRON- those six and thirty man of -PRON- could easily keep the ship free never mind if the leak should double on -PRON-
chapter_54	in truth well nigh the whole of this passage be attend by very prosperous breeze the town ho have all but certainly arrive in perfect safety at -PRON- port without the occurrence of the least fatality have -PRON- not be for the brutal overbearing of radney the mate a vineyarder and the bitterly provoke vengeance of steelkilt a lakeman and desperado from buffalo lakeman!--buffalo
chapter_54	-PRON- crave -PRON- courtesy may be -PRON- shall soon hear further of all that
chapter_54	now gentleman in square sail brig and three mast ship well nigh as large and stout as any that ever sail out of -PRON- old callao to far manilla this lakeman in the land lock heart of -PRON- america have yet be nurture by all those agrarian freebooting impression popularly connect with the open ocean
chapter_54	for in -PRON- interflow aggregate those grand fresh water sea of our erie and ontario and huron and superior and michigan possess an ocean like expansiveness with many of the ocean 's noble trait with many of -PRON- rimmed variety of race and of clime
chapter_54	yet be this nantucketer a man with some good hearted trait and this lakeman a mariner who though a sort of devil indeed may yet by inflexible firmness only temper by that common decency of human recognition which be the mean slave 's right thus treat this steelkilt have long be retain harmless and docile
chapter_54	-PRON- be not more than a day or two at the furth after point -PRON- prow for -PRON- island haven that the town ho 's leak seem again increase but only so as to require an hour or more at the pump every day
chapter_54	-PRON- must know that in a settle and civilized ocean like -PRON- atlantic for example some skipper think little of pump -PRON- whole way across -PRON- though of a still sleepy night should the officer of the deck happen to forget -PRON- duty in that respect the probability would be that -PRON- and -PRON- shipmate would never again remember -PRON- on account of all hand gently subside to the bottom
chapter_54	nor in the solitary and savage sea far from -PRON- to the westward gentleman be -PRON- altogether unusual for ship to keep clang at -PRON- pump handle in full chorus even for a voyage of considerable length that is if -PRON- lie along a tolerably accessible coast or if any other reasonable retreat be afford -PRON-
chapter_54	-PRON- be only when a leaky vessel be in some very out of the way part of those water some really landless latitude that -PRON- captain begin to feel a little anxious
chapter_54	-PRON- command the upper sail to be well hoist sheet home anew and every way expand to the breeze
chapter_54	now this radney -PRON- suppose be as little of a coward and as little inclined to any sort of nervous apprehensiveness touch -PRON- own person as any fearless unthinking creature on land or on sea that -PRON- can conveniently imagine gentleman
chapter_54	therefore when -PRON- betray this solicitude about the safety of the ship some of the seaman declare that -PRON- be only on account of -PRON- be a part owner in -PRON-
chapter_54	now as -PRON- well know -PRON- be not seldom the case in this conventional world of our watery or otherwise that when a person place in command over -PRON- fellow man find one of -PRON- to be very significantly -PRON- superior in general pride of manhood straightway against that man -PRON- conceive an unconquerable dislike and bitterness and if -PRON- have a chance -PRON- will pull down and pulverize that subaltern 's tower and make a little heap of dust of -PRON-
chapter_54	be this conceit of mine as -PRON- may gentleman at all event steelkilt be a tall and noble animal with a head like a roman and a flow golden beard like the tasseled housing of -PRON- last viceroy 's snort charger and a brain and a heart and a soul in -PRON- gentleman which have make steelkilt charlemagne have -PRON- be bear son to charlemagne 's father
chapter_54	-PRON- do not love steelkilt and steelkilt know -PRON-
chapter_54	espy the mate draw near as -PRON- be toil at the pump with the rest the lakeman affect not to notice -PRON- but unawed go on with -PRON- gay bantering
chapter_54	aye aye -PRON- merry lad -PRON- be a lively leak this hold a cannikin one of ye and let -PRON- have a taste
chapter_54	by the lord -PRON- be worth bottling
chapter_54	the fact be boy that sword fish only begin the job -PRON- be come back again with a gang of ship carpenter see fish and file fish and what not and the whole posse of -PRON- be now hard at work cut and slash at the bottom make improvement -PRON- suppose
chapter_54	if old rad be here now -PRON- would tell -PRON- to jump overboard and scatter -PRON-
chapter_54	-PRON- be play the devil with -PRON- estate -PRON- can tell -PRON-
chapter_54	but -PRON- be a simple old soul rad and a beauty too
chapter_54	damn -PRON- eye
chapter_54	what be that pump stop for
chapter_54	thunder away at -PRON-
chapter_54	aye aye sir say steelkilt merry as a cricket
chapter_54	lively boy lively now
chapter_54	and with that the pump clang like fifty fire engine the man toss -PRON- hat off to -PRON- and ere long that peculiar gasping of the lung be hear which denote the full tension of life 's utmost energy
chapter_54	quit the pump at last with the rest of -PRON- band the lakeman go forward all pant and sit -PRON- down on the windlass -PRON- face fiery red -PRON- eye bloodshot and wipe the profuse sweat from -PRON- brow
chapter_54	now what cozen fiend -PRON- be gentleman that possess radney to meddle with such a man in that corporeally exasperated state -PRON- know not
chapter_54	but in all vessel this broom business be the prescriptive province of the boy if boy there be aboard
chapter_54	besides -PRON- be the strong man in the town ho that have be divide into gang take turn at the pump and be the most athletic seaman of -PRON- all steelkilt have be regularly assign captain of one of the gang consequently -PRON- should have be free from any trivial business not connect with truly nautical duty such be the case with -PRON- comrade
chapter_54	any man who have go sailor in a whale ship will understand this and all this and doubtless much more the lakeman fully comprehend when the mate utter -PRON- command
chapter_54	steelkilt rise and slowly retreat round the windlass steadily follow by the mate with -PRON- menacing hammer deliberately repeat -PRON- intention not to obey
chapter_54	see however that -PRON- forbearance have not the slight effect by an awful and unspeakable intimation with -PRON- twisted hand -PRON- warn off the foolish and infatuated man but -PRON- be to no purpose
chapter_54	and in this way the two go once slowly round the windlass when resolve at last no longer to retreat bethink -PRON- that -PRON- have now forbear as much as comport with -PRON- humor the lakeman pause on the hatch and thus speak to the officer
chapter_54	mr
chapter_54	radney -PRON- will not obey -PRON-
chapter_54	take that hammer away or look to -PRON-
chapter_54	retreat not the thousandth part of an inch stab -PRON- in the eye with the unflinching poniard of -PRON- glance steelkilt clench -PRON- right hand behind -PRON- and creepingly draw -PRON- back tell -PRON- persecutor that if the hammer but graze -PRON- cheek -PRON- steelkilt would murder -PRON-
chapter_54	but gentleman the fool have be brand for the slaughter by the god
chapter_54	immediately the hammer touch the cheek the next instant the low jaw of the mate be stove in -PRON- head -PRON- fall on the hatch spout blood like a whale
chapter_54	ere the cry could go aft steelkilt be shake one of the backstay lead far aloft to where two of -PRON- comrade be stand -PRON- masthead
chapter_54	-PRON- be both canallers
chapter_54	pardon who and what be -PRON-
chapter_54	canallers don be the boatman belong to -PRON- grand erie canal
chapter_54	-PRON- must have hear of -PRON-
chapter_54	nay senor hereabouts in this dull warm most lazy and hereditary land -PRON- know but little of -PRON- vigorous north
chapter_54	-PRON- chicha be very fine and ere proceed further
chapter_54	-PRON- will tell ye what -PRON- canallers be for such information may throw side light upon -PRON- story
chapter_54	for three hundred and sixty mile gentleman through the entire breadth of the state of new york through numerous populous city and most thriving village through long dismal uninhabited swamp and affluent cultivate field unrivalled for fertility by billiard room and bar room through the holy of holies of great forest on roman arch over indian river through sun and shade by happy heart or break through all the wide contrast scenery of those noble mohawk county and especially by row of snow white chapel whose spire stand almost like milestone flow one continual stream of venetianly corrupt and often lawless life
chapter_54	be that a friar passing say don pedro look downwards into the crowded plazza with humorous concern
chapter_54	proceed senor a moment
chapter_54	"oh do not bow and look surprised -PRON- know the proverb all along this coast--""corrupt as lima"

chapter_54	freely depict in -PRON- own vocation gentleman the canaller would make a fine dramatic hero so abundantly and picturesquely wicked be -PRON-
chapter_54	but ashore all this effeminacy be dash
chapter_54	the brigandish guise which the canaller so proudly sport -PRON- slouched and gaily ribbon hat betoken -PRON- grand feature
chapter_54	in sum gentleman what the wildness of this canal life be be emphatically evince by this that -PRON- wild whale fishery contain so many of -PRON- most finished graduate and that scarce any race of mankind except sydney man be so much distrust by -PRON- whaling captain
chapter_54	nor do -PRON- at all diminish the curiousness of this matter that to many thousand of -PRON- rural boy and young man bear along -PRON- line the probationary life of the grand canal furnish the sole transition between quietly reap in a christian corn field and recklessly plough the water of the most barbaric sea
chapter_54	-PRON- see
chapter_54	no need to travel
chapter_54	-PRON- have think now that at -PRON- temperate north the generation be cold and holy as the hill
chapter_54	at interval -PRON- run close up to the revolving border of the confusion and pry into the heart of -PRON- with -PRON- pike seek to prick out the object of -PRON- resentment
chapter_54	come out of that ye pirate
chapter_54	steelkilt leap on the barricade and stride up and down there defy the bad the pistol could do but give the captain to understand distinctly that -PRON- steelkilt 's death would be the signal for a murderous mutiny on the part of all hand
chapter_54	fear in -PRON- heart lest this may prove but too true the captain a little desist but still command the insurgent instantly to return to -PRON- duty will -PRON- promise not to touch -PRON- if -PRON- do demand -PRON- ringleader
chapter_54	do -PRON- want to sink the ship by knock off at a time like this
chapter_54	sink the ship cry steelkilt
chapter_54	not a man of -PRON- turn to unless -PRON- swear not to raise a rope yarn against -PRON-
chapter_54	what say ye man
chapter_54	turn to -PRON- comrade
chapter_54	a fierce cheer be -PRON- response
chapter_54	the lakeman now patrol the barricade all the while keep -PRON- eye on the captain and jerk out such sentence as these:--'it 's not -PRON- fault -PRON- do not want -PRON- -PRON- tell -PRON- to take -PRON- hammer away -PRON- be boy 's business -PRON- may have know -PRON- before this -PRON- tell -PRON- not to prick the buffalo -PRON- believe -PRON- have break a finger here against -PRON- cursed jaw be not those mince knife down in the forecastle there man
chapter_54	captain by god look to -PRON- say the word do not be a fool forget -PRON- all -PRON- be ready to turn to treat -PRON- decently and -PRON- be -PRON- man but -PRON- will not be flog
chapter_54	turn to
chapter_54	-PRON- make no promise turn to -PRON- say
chapter_54	look ye now cry the lakeman fling out -PRON- arm towards -PRON-
chapter_54	turn to roar the captain
chapter_54	down ye go
chapter_54	most of -PRON- be against -PRON- but at length in obedience to steelkilt -PRON- precede -PRON- down into -PRON- dark den growlingly disappear like bear into a cave
chapter_54	then open the slide a little the captain whisper something down the crack close -PRON- and turn the key upon -PRON- ten in number leave on deck some twenty or more who thus far have remain neutral
chapter_54	all night a wide awake watch be keep by all the officer forward and aft especially about the forecastle scuttle and fore hatchway at which last place -PRON- be fear the insurgent may emerge after break through the bulkhead below
chapter_54	but the hour of darkness pass in peace the man who still remain at -PRON- duty toil hard at the pump whose clinking and clank at interval through the dreary night dismally resound through the ship
chapter_54	at sunrise the captain go forward and knock on the deck summon the prisoner to work but with a yell -PRON- refuse
chapter_54	twice every day for three day this be repeat but on the fourth morning a confused wrangling and then a scuffling be hear as the customary summon be deliver and suddenly four man burst up from the forecastle say -PRON- be ready to turn to
chapter_54	the fetid closeness of the air and a famish diet unite perhaps to some fear of ultimate retribution have constrain -PRON- to surrender at discretion
chapter_54	embolden by this the captain reiterate -PRON- demand to the rest but steelkilt shout up to -PRON- a terrific hint to stop -PRON- babbling and betake -PRON- where -PRON- belong
chapter_54	only three be leave
chapter_54	better turn to now
chapter_54	say the captain with a heartless jeer
chapter_54	for -PRON- -PRON- would do this -PRON- say whether -PRON- join -PRON- or not
chapter_54	but the scheme meet with no opposition on the part of the other two -PRON- swear -PRON- be ready for that or for any other mad thing for anything in short but a surrender
chapter_54	and what be more -PRON- each insist upon be the first man on deck when the time to make the rush should come
chapter_54	but to this -PRON- leader as fiercely object reserve that priority for -PRON- particularly as -PRON- two comrade would not yield the one to the other in the matter and both of -PRON- could not be first for the ladder would but admit one man at a time
chapter_54	and here gentleman the foul play of these miscreant must come out
chapter_54	but all these be collar and drag along the deck like dead cattle and side by side be seize up into the mizzen rigging like three quarter of meat and there -PRON- hang till morning
chapter_54	damn ye cry the captain pace to and fro before -PRON- the vulture would not touch ye ye villain
chapter_54	but as for -PRON- ye carrion rogue turn to the three man in the rigging--'for -PRON- -PRON- mean to mince ye up for the try pot and seize a rope -PRON- apply -PRON- with all -PRON- might to the back of the two traitor till -PRON- yell no more but lifelessly hang -PRON- head sideways as the two crucify thief be draw
chapter_54	-PRON- wrist be sprain with ye
chapter_54	for a moment the exhausted mutineer make a tremulous motion of -PRON- cramped jaw and then painfully twist round -PRON- head say in a sort of hiss what -PRON- say be this and mind -PRON- well if -PRON- flog -PRON- -PRON- murder -PRON-
chapter_54	say ye so
chapter_54	then see how ye frighten me'--and
chapter_54	the captain draw off with the rope to strike
chapter_54	but -PRON- must,'--and the rope be once more draw back for the stroke
chapter_54	radney the chief mate
chapter_54	ever since the blow -PRON- have lie in -PRON- berth but that morning hear the tumult on the deck -PRON- have creep out and thus far have watch the whole scene
chapter_54	such be the state of -PRON- mouth that -PRON- could hardly speak but mumble something about -PRON- be willing and able to do what the captain dare not attempt -PRON- snatch the rope and advance to -PRON- pinioned foe
chapter_54	-PRON- be a coward
chapter_54	hiss the lakeman
chapter_54	so -PRON- be but take that
chapter_54	the mate be in the very act of striking when another hiss stay -PRON- uplifted arm
chapter_54	-PRON- pause and then pause no more make good -PRON- word spite of steelkilt 's threat whatev that may have be
chapter_54	just after dark that day when one watch have retire below a clamor be hear in the forecastle and the two tremble traitor run up besiege the cabin door say -PRON- durst not consort with the crew
chapter_54	entreaty cuff and kick could not drive -PRON- back so at -PRON- own instance -PRON- be put down in the ship 's run for salvation
chapter_54	on the contrary -PRON- seem that mainly at steelkilt 's instigation -PRON- have resolve to maintain the strict peacefulness obey all order to the last and when the ship reach port desert -PRON- in a body
chapter_54	for spite of -PRON- leak and spite of all -PRON- other peril the town ho still maintain -PRON- mast head and -PRON- captain be just as willing to lower for a fish that moment as on the day -PRON- craft first strike the cruising ground and radney the mate be quite as ready to change -PRON- berth for a boat and with -PRON- bandage mouth seek to gag in death the vital jaw of the whale
chapter_54	but though the lakeman have induce the seaman to adopt this sort of passiveness in -PRON- conduct -PRON- keep -PRON- own counsel at least till all be over concern -PRON- own proper and private revenge upon the man who have sting -PRON- in the ventricle of -PRON- heart
chapter_54	-PRON- be in radney the chief mate 's watch and as if the infatuated man seek to run more than half way to meet -PRON- doom after the scene at the rigging -PRON- insist against the express counsel of the captain upon resume the head of -PRON- watch at night
chapter_54	upon this and one or two other circumstance steelkilt systematically build the plan of -PRON- revenge
chapter_54	during the night radney have an unseamanlike way of sit on the bulwark of the quarter deck and lean -PRON- arm upon the gunwale of the boat which be hoist up there a little above the ship 's side
chapter_54	at -PRON- leisure -PRON- employ the interval in braid something very carefully in -PRON- watch below
chapter_54	say a shipmate
chapter_54	what do -PRON- think
chapter_54	what do -PRON- look like
chapter_54	like a lanyard for -PRON- bag but -PRON- be an odd one seem to -PRON-
chapter_54	but -PRON- think -PRON- will answer
chapter_54	but there be none in the forecastle then -PRON- must get some from old rad and -PRON- rise to go aft -PRON- do not mean to go a begging to him
chapter_54	say a sailor
chapter_54	do -PRON- think -PRON- will not do -PRON- a turn when -PRON- be to help -PRON- in the end shipmate and go to the mate -PRON- look at -PRON- quietly and ask -PRON- for some twine to mend -PRON- hammock
chapter_54	-PRON- be give -PRON- neither twine nor lanyard be see again but the next night an iron ball closely net partly roll from the pocket of the lakeman 's monkey jacket as -PRON- be tuck the coat into -PRON- hammock for a pillow
chapter_54	twenty four hour after -PRON- trick at the silent helm nigh to the man who be apt to doze over the grave always ready dig to the seaman 's hand that fatal hour be then to come and in the fore ordain soul of steelkilt the mate be already stark and stretch as a corpse with -PRON- forehead crush in
chapter_54	yet complete revenge -PRON- have and without be the avenger
chapter_54	for by a mysterious fatality heaven -PRON- seem to step in to take out of -PRON- hand into -PRON- own the damning thing -PRON- would have do
chapter_54	-PRON- be just between daybreak and sunrise of the morning of the second day when -PRON- be wash down the deck that a stupid teneriffe man draw water in the main chain all at once shout out there -PRON- roll
chapter_54	there -PRON- roll
chapter_54	cry don sebastian st. dominic
chapter_54	how
chapter_54	-PRON- can not rehearse that now
chapter_54	let -PRON- get more into the air sirs
chapter_54	the chicha
chapter_54	no need gentleman one moment and -PRON- proceed
chapter_54	all be now a phrensy
chapter_54	gentlemen a strange fatality pervade the whole career of these event as if verily map out before the world -PRON- be chart
chapter_54	moreover when the four boat be lower the mate 's get the start and none howl more fiercely with delight than do steelkilt as -PRON- strained at -PRON- oar
chapter_54	after a stiff pull -PRON- harpooneer get fast and spear in hand radney spring to the bow
chapter_54	-PRON- be always a furious man -PRON- seem in a boat
chapter_54	-PRON- cut -PRON- and the whale be free
chapter_54	but at some distance moby dick rise again with some tatter of radney 's red woollen shirt catch in the tooth that have destroy -PRON-
chapter_54	in good time the town ho reach -PRON- port a savage solitary place where no civilized creature reside
chapter_54	there head by the lakeman all but five or six of the foremastman deliberately deserted among the palm eventually as -PRON- turn out seize a large double war canoe of the savage and set sail for some other harbor
chapter_54	the ship 's company be reduce to but a handful the captain call upon the islanders to assist -PRON- in the laborious business of heave down the ship to stop the leak
chapter_54	but to such unresting vigilance over -PRON- dangerous ally be this small band of white necessitate both by night and by day and so extreme be the hard work -PRON- undergo that upon the vessel be ready again for sea -PRON- be in such a weakened condition that the captain durst not put off with -PRON- in so heavy a vessel
chapter_54	on the fourth day of the sail a large canoe be descry which seem to have touch at a low isle of coral
chapter_54	-PRON- steer away from -PRON- but the savage craft bear down on -PRON- and soon the voice of steelkilt hail -PRON- to heave to or -PRON- would run -PRON- under water
chapter_54	cry the captain
chapter_54	where be -PRON- bind
chapter_54	-PRON- be bind to tahiti for more man
chapter_54	very good
chapter_54	let -PRON- board -PRON- a moment -PRON- come in peace
chapter_54	cross -PRON- arm sir throw back -PRON- head
chapter_54	now repeat after -PRON-
chapter_54	as soon as steelkilt leave -PRON- -PRON- swear to beach this boat on yonder island and remain there six day
chapter_54	a pretty scholar laugh the lakeman
chapter_54	adios senor and leap into the sea
chapter_54	watch the boat till -PRON- be fairly beach and draw up to the root of the cocoa nut tree steelkilt make sail again and in due time arrive at tahiti -PRON- own place of destination
chapter_54	there luck befriend -PRON- two ship be about to sail for france and be providentially in want of precisely that number of man which the sailor head
chapter_54	-PRON- embark and so for ever get the start of -PRON- former captain have -PRON- be at all minded to work -PRON- legal retribution
chapter_54	charter a small native schooner -PRON- return with -PRON- to -PRON- vessel and find all right there again resume -PRON- cruising
chapter_54	where steelkilt now be gentleman none know but upon the island of nantucket the widow of radney still turn to the sea which refuse to give up -PRON- dead still in dream see the awful white whale that destroy -PRON-
chapter_54	then -PRON- entreat -PRON- tell -PRON- if to the good of -PRON- own conviction this -PRON- story be in substance really true
chapter_54	-PRON- be so pass wonderful
chapter_54	do -PRON- get -PRON- from an unquestionable source
chapter_54	bear with -PRON- if -PRON- seem to press
chapter_54	also bear with all of -PRON- sir sailor for -PRON- all join in don sebastian 's suit cry the company with exceed interest
chapter_54	be there a copy of the holy evangelists in the golden inn gentleman
chapter_54	nay say don sebastian
chapter_54	will -PRON- be so good as to bring the priest also don
chapter_54	let -PRON- withdraw more out of the moonlight
chapter_54	-PRON- see no need of this
chapter_54	excuse -PRON- for run after -PRON- don sebastian but may -PRON- also beg that -PRON- will be particular in procure the large sized evangelist -PRON- can
chapter_54	this be the priest -PRON- bring -PRON- the evangelists say don sebastian gravely return with a tall and solemn figure let -PRON- remove -PRON- hat
chapter_54	now venerable priest further into the light and hold the holy book before -PRON- that -PRON- may touch -PRON-
chapter_54	so help -PRON- heaven and on -PRON- honour the story -PRON- have tell ye gentleman be in substance and -PRON- great item true
chapter_55	of the monstrous pictures of whales -PRON- shall ere long paint to -PRON- as well as one can without canvas something like the true form of the whale as -PRON- actually appear to the eye of the whaleman when in -PRON- own absolute body the whale be moor alongside the whale ship so that -PRON- can be fairly step upon there
chapter_55	-PRON- may be worth while therefore previously to advert to those curious imaginary portrait of -PRON- which even down to the present day confidently challenge the faith of the landsman
chapter_55	for ever since those inventive but unscrupulous time when on the marble panelling of temple the pedestal of statue and on shield medallion cup and coin the dolphin be draw in scale of chain armor like saladin 's and a helmeted head like st. george 's ever since then have something of the same sort of license prevail not only in most popular picture of the whale but in many scientific presentation of -PRON-
chapter_55	now by all odd the most ancient extant portrait anyways purport to be the whale 's be to be find in the famous cavern pagoda of elephanta in india
chapter_55	the brahmins maintain that in the almost endless sculpture of that immemorial pagoda all the trade and pursuit every conceivable avocation of man be prefigure age before any of -PRON- actually come into be
chapter_55	but though this sculpture be half man and half whale so as only to give the tail of the latter yet that small section of -PRON- be all wrong
chapter_55	-PRON- look more like the taper tail of an anaconda than the broad palm of the true whale 's majestic fluke
chapter_55	-PRON- be guido 's picture of perseus rescue andromeda from the sea monster or whale
chapter_55	nor do hogarth in paint the same scene in -PRON- own perseus descend make out one whit better
chapter_55	-PRON- have a sort of howdah on -PRON- back and -PRON- distended tusked mouth into which the billow be roll may be take for the traitors gate lead from the thames by water into the tower
chapter_55	what shall be say of these
chapter_55	as for the book binder 's whale winding like a vine stalk round the stock of a descend anchor as stamp and gild on the back and title page of many book both old and new that be a very picturesque but purely fabulous creature imitate -PRON- take -PRON- from the like figure on antique vas
chapter_55	though universally denominate a dolphin -PRON- nevertheless call this book binder 's fish an attempt at a whale because -PRON- be so intend when the device be first introduce
chapter_55	-PRON- be introduce by an old italian publisher somewhere about the 15th century during the revival of learning and in those day and even down to a comparatively late period dolphin be popularly suppose to be a species of the leviathan
chapter_55	in the vignette and other embellishment of some ancient book -PRON- will at time meet with very curious touch at the whale where all manner of spout jet d'eau hot spring and cold saratoga and baden baden come bubble up from -PRON- unexhausted brain
chapter_55	but quit all these unprofessional attempt let -PRON- glance at those picture of leviathan purport to be sober scientific delineation by those who know
chapter_55	in old harris 's collection of voyage there be some plate of whale extract from a dutch book of voyage a.d. 1671 entitle a whaling voyage to spitzbergen in the ship jonas in the whale peter peterson of friesland master
chapter_55	in one of those plate the whale like great raft of log be represent lie among ice isle with white bear run over -PRON- living back
chapter_55	in another plate the prodigious blunder be make of represent the whale with perpendicular fluke
chapter_55	in this book be an outline purport to be a picture of a physeter or spermaceti whale draw by scale from one kill on the coast of mexico august 1793 and hoist on deck
chapter_55	to mention but one thing about -PRON- let -PRON- say that -PRON- have an eye which apply accord to the accompany scale to a full grown sperm whale would make the eye of that whale a bow window some five foot long
chapter_55	ah -PRON- gallant captain why do ye not give -PRON- jonah look out of that eye
chapter_55	nor be the most conscientious compilation of natural history for the benefit of the young and tender free from the same heinousness of mistake
chapter_55	look at that popular work goldsmith 's animated nature
chapter_55	in the abridge london edition of 1807 there be plate of an alleged whale and a narwhale
chapter_55	then again in 1825 bernard germain count de lacepede a great naturalist publish a scientific systemized whale book wherein be several picture of the different specie of the leviathan
chapter_55	these be not only incorrect but the picture of the mysticetus or greenland whale that be to say the right whale even scoresby a long experienced man as touch that species declare not to have -PRON- counterpart in nature
chapter_55	perhaps -PRON- get -PRON- as -PRON- scientific predecessor in the same field desmarest get one of -PRON- authentic abortion that is from a chinese drawing
chapter_55	and what sort of lively lad with the pencil those chinese be many queer cup and saucer inform -PRON-
chapter_55	as for the sign painter whale see in the street hang over the shop of oil dealer what shall be say of -PRON-
chapter_55	-PRON- be generally richard iii
chapter_55	whale with dromedary hump and very savage breakfasting on three or four sailor tart that be whaleboat full of mariner -PRON- deformity flounder in sea of blood and blue paint
chapter_55	consider
chapter_55	most of the scientific drawing have be take from the strand fish and these be about as correct as a drawing of a wreck ship with break back would correctly represent the noble animal -PRON- in all -PRON- undashed pride of hull and spar
chapter_55	though elephant have stand for -PRON- full length the live leviathan have never yet fairly float -PRON- for -PRON- portrait
chapter_55	and not to speak of the highly presumable difference of contour between a young suck whale and a full grow platonian leviathan yet even in the case of one of those young suck whale hoist to a ship 's deck such be then the outlandish eel like limber vary shape of -PRON- that -PRON- precise expression the devil -PRON- could not catch
chapter_55	but -PRON- may be fancy that from the naked skeleton of the stranded whale accurate hint may be derive touch -PRON- true form
chapter_55	though jeremy bentham 's skeleton which hang for candelabra in the library of one of -PRON- executor correctly convey the idea of a burly browed utilitarian old gentleman with all jeremy 's other lead personal characteristic yet nothing of this kind could be infer from any leviathan 's articulate bone
chapter_55	in fact as the great hunter say the mere skeleton of the whale bear the same relation to the fully invest and pad animal as the insect do to the chrysalis that so roundingly envelope -PRON-
chapter_55	this peculiarity be strikingly evinced in the head as in some part of this book will be incidentally show
chapter_55	-PRON- be also very curiously display in the side fin the bone of which almost exactly answer to the bone of the human hand minus only the thumb
chapter_55	this fin have four regular bone finger the index middle ring and little finger
chapter_55	however recklessly the whale may sometimes serve -PRON- say humorous stubb one day -PRON- can never be truly say to handle -PRON- without mitten
chapter_55	for all these reason then any way -PRON- may look at -PRON- -PRON- must need conclude that the great leviathan be that one creature in the world which must remain unpainted to the last
chapter_55	true one portrait may hit the mark much nearer than another but none can hit -PRON- with any very considerable degree of exactness
chapter_55	so there be no earthly way of find out precisely what the whale really look like
chapter_55	and the only mode in which -PRON- can derive even a tolerable idea of -PRON- living contour be by go a whaling -PRON- but by so do -PRON- run no small risk of be eternally stave and sink by -PRON-
chapter_55	wherefore -PRON- seem to -PRON- -PRON- have best not be too fastidious in -PRON- curiosity touch this leviathan
chapter_56	of the less erroneous pictures of whales and the true pictures of whaling scenes
chapter_56	in connexion with the monstrous picture of whale -PRON- be strongly tempt here to enter upon those still more monstrous story of -PRON- which be to be find in certain book both ancient and modern especially in pliny purchas hackluyt harris cuvier etc
chapter_56	but -PRON- pass that matter by
chapter_56	-PRON- know of only four publish outline of the great sperm whale colnett 's huggins 's frederick cuvier 's and beale 's
chapter_56	huggins 's be far good than -PRON- but by great odd beale 's be the good
chapter_56	-PRON- frontispiece boat attack sperm whales though no doubt calculate to excite the civil scepticism of some parlor man be admirably correct and life like in -PRON- general effect
chapter_56	some of the sperm whale drawing in j. ross browne be pretty correct in contour but -PRON- be wretchedly engrave
chapter_56	that be not -PRON- fault though
chapter_56	of the right whale the good outline picture be in scoresby but -PRON- be draw on too small a scale to convey a desirable impression
chapter_56	-PRON- have but one picture of whaling scene and this be a sad deficiency because -PRON- be by such picture only when at all well do that -PRON- can derive anything like a truthful idea of the live whale as see by -PRON- living hunter
chapter_56	but take for all in all by far the fine though in some detail not the most correct presentation of whale and whaling scene to be anywhere find be two large french engraving well execute and take from painting by one garnery
chapter_56	respectively -PRON- represent attack on the sperm and right whale
chapter_56	in the first engrave a noble sperm whale be depict in full majesty of might just rise beneath the boat from the profundity of the ocean and bear high in the air upon -PRON- back the terrific wreck of the stoven plank
chapter_56	the prow of the boat be partially unbroken and be draw just balance upon the monster 's spine and stand in that prow for that one single incomputable flash of time -PRON- behold an oarsman half shroud by the incensed boil spout of the whale and in the act of leap as if from a precipice
chapter_56	-PRON- jet be erect full and black like soot so that from so abound a smoke in the chimney -PRON- would think there must be a brave supper cook in the great bowel below
chapter_56	and all the while the thick lipped leviathan be rush through the deep leave ton of tumultuous white curd in -PRON- wake and cause the slight boat to rock in the swell like a skiff catch nigh the paddle wheel of an ocean steamer
chapter_56	who garnery the painter be or be -PRON- know not
chapter_56	go and gaze upon all the painting of europe and where will -PRON- find such a gallery of living and breathing commotion on canvas as in that triumphal hall at versailles where the beholder fight -PRON- way pell mell through the consecutive great battle of france where every sword seem a flash of the northern lights and the successive armed king and emperors dash by like a charge of crown centaur
chapter_56	not wholly unworthy of a place in that gallery be these sea battle piece of garnery
chapter_56	with not one tenth of england 's experience in the fishery and not the thousandth part of that of the americans -PRON- have nevertheless furnish both nation with the only finish sketch at all capable of convey the real spirit of the whale hunt
chapter_56	for the most part the english and american whale draughtsman seem entirely content with present the mechanical outline of thing such as the vacant profile of the whale which so far as picturesqueness of effect be concern be about tantamount to sketch the profile of a pyramid
chapter_56	even scoresby the justly renowned right whaleman after give -PRON- a stiff full length of the greenland whale and three or four delicate miniature of narwhale and porpoise treat -PRON- to a series of classical engraving of boat hook chop knife and grapnel and with the microscopic diligence of a leuwenhoeck submit to the inspection of a shiver world ninety six fac simile of magnified arctic snow crystal
chapter_56	-PRON- mean no disparagement to the excellent voyager -PRON- honour -PRON- for a veteran but in so important a matter -PRON- be certainly an oversight not to have procure for every crystal a swear affidavit take before a greenland justice of the peace
chapter_56	in addition to those fine engraving from garnery there be two other french engraving worthy of note by some one who subscribe -PRON- h. durand
chapter_56	-PRON- be a quiet noon scene among the isle of the pacific a french whaler anchor inshore in a calm and lazily take water on board the loosen sail of the ship and the long leaf of the palm in the background both droop together in the breezeless air
chapter_56	the effect be very fine when consider with reference to -PRON- present the hardy fisherman under one of -PRON- few aspect of oriental repose
chapter_56	the other engraving be quite a different affair the ship hove to upon the open sea and in the very heart of the leviathanic life with a right whale alongside the vessel in the act of cut in hove over to the monster as if to a quay and a boat hurriedly push off from this scene of activity be about give chase to whale in the distance
chapter_56	the harpoon and lance lie level for use three oarsman be just set the mast in -PRON- hole while from a sudden roll of the sea the little craft stand half erect out of the water like a rearing horse
chapter_57	of whales in paint in teeth in wood in sheet iron in stone in mountains in stars
chapter_57	there be three whale and three boat and one of the boat presume to contain the miss leg in all -PRON- original integrity be be crunch by the jaw of the foremost whale
chapter_57	any time these ten year -PRON- tell -PRON- have that man hold up that picture and exhibit that stump to an incredulous world
chapter_57	throughout the pacific and also in nantucket and new bedford and sag harbor -PRON- will come across lively sketch of whale and whaling scene grave by the fisherman -PRON- on sperm whale tooth or lady busk work out of the right whale bone and other like skrimshander article as the whaleman call the numerous little ingenious contrivance -PRON- elaborately carve out of the rough material in -PRON- hour of ocean leisure
chapter_57	but in general -PRON- toil with -PRON- jack knife alone and with that almost omnipotent tool of the sailor -PRON- will turn -PRON- out anything -PRON- please in the way of a mariner 's fancy
chapter_57	long exile from christendom and civilization inevitably restore a man to that condition in which god place -PRON- i.e. what be call savagery
chapter_57	-PRON- true whale hunter be as much a savage as an iroquois
chapter_57	now one of the peculiar characteristic of the savage in -PRON- domestic hour be -PRON- wonderful patience of industry
chapter_57	an ancient hawaiian war club or spear paddle in -PRON- full multiplicity and elaboration of carving be as great a trophy of human perseverance as a latin lexicon
chapter_57	for with but a bit of broken sea shell or a shark 's tooth that miraculous intricacy of wooden net work have be achieve and -PRON- have cost steady year of steady application
chapter_57	as with the hawaiian savage so with the white sailor savage
chapter_57	with the same marvellous patience and with the same single shark 's tooth of -PRON- one poor jack knife -PRON- will carve -PRON- a bit of bone sculpture not quite as workmanlike but as close pack in -PRON- maziness of design as the greek savage achilles 's shield and full of barbaric spirit and suggestiveness as the print of that fine old dutch savage albert durer
chapter_57	wooden whale or whale cut in profile out of the small dark slab of the noble south sea war wood be frequently meet with in the forecastle of american whaler
chapter_57	at some old gable roof country house -PRON- will see brass whale hang by the tail for knocker to the road side door
chapter_57	but these knock whale be seldom remarkable as faithful essay
chapter_57	on the spire of some old fashioned church -PRON- will see sheet iron whale place there for weather cock but -PRON- be so elevated and besides that be to all intent and purpose so label with hand off
chapter_57	-PRON- can not examine -PRON- closely enough to decide upon -PRON- merit
chapter_57	in bony ribby region of the earth where at the base of high broken cliff mass of rock lie strew in fantastic grouping upon the plain -PRON- will often discover image as of the petrified form of the leviathan partly merge in grass which of a windy day break against -PRON- in a surf of green surge
chapter_57	then again in mountainous country where the traveller be continually girdle by amphitheatrical height here and there from some lucky point of view -PRON- will catch pass glimpse of the profile of whale define along the undulate ridge
chapter_57	but -PRON- must be a thorough whaleman to see these sight and not only that but if -PRON- wish to return to such a sight again -PRON- must be sure and take the exact intersect latitude and longitude of -PRON- first stand point else so chance like be such observation of the hill that -PRON- precise previous stand point would require a laborious re discovery like the soloma islands which still remain incognita though once high ruff mendanna tread -PRON- and
chapter_57	old figuera chronicle -PRON-
chapter_57	thus at the north have -PRON- chase leviathan round and round the pole with the revolution of the bright point that first define -PRON- to -PRON-
chapter_57	and beneath the effulgent antarctic sky -PRON- have board the argo navis and join the chase against the starry cetus far beyond the utmost stretch of hydrus and the flying fish
chapter_58	brit steering north eastward from the crozetts -PRON- fall in with vast meadow of brit the minute yellow substance upon which the right whale largely feed
chapter_58	on the second day number of right whales be see who secure from the attack of a sperm whaler like the pequod with open jaw sluggishly swim through the brit which adhere to the fringing fibre of that wondrous venetian blind in -PRON- mouth be in that manner separate from the water that escape at the lip
chapter_58	as morning mower who side by side slowly and seethingly advance -PRON- scythe through the long wet grass of marshy mead even so these monster swim make a strange grassy cut sound and leave behind -PRON- endless swath of blue upon the yellow sea
chapter_58	that part of the sea know among whaleman as the brazil banks do not bear that name as the banks of newfoundland do because of there be shallow and sounding there but because of this remarkable meadow like appearance cause by the vast drift of brit continually float in those latitude where the right whale be often chase
chapter_58	see from the mast head especially when -PRON- pause and be stationary for a while -PRON- vast black form look more like lifeless mass of rock than anything else
chapter_58	and as in the great hunting country of india the stranger at a distance will sometimes pass on the plain recumbent elephant without know -PRON- to be such take -PRON- for bare blacken elevation of the soil even so often with -PRON- who for the first time behold this species of the leviathan of the sea
chapter_58	and even when recognise at last -PRON- immense magnitude render -PRON- very hard really to believe that such bulky mass of overgrowth can possibly be instinct in all part with the same sort of life that live in a dog or a horse
chapter_58	indeed in other respect -PRON- can hardly regard any creature of the deep with the same feeling that -PRON- do those of the shore
chapter_58	the accursed shark alone can in any generic respect be say to bear comparative analogy to -PRON-
chapter_58	but though to landsman in general the native inhabitant of the sea have ever be regard with emotion unspeakably unsocial and repel though -PRON- know the sea to be an everlasting terra incognita so that columbus sail over numberless unknown world to discover -PRON- one superficial western one though by vast odd the most terrific of all mortal disaster have immemorially and indiscriminately befall ten and hundred of thousand of those who have go upon the water though but a moment 's consideration will teach that however baby man may brag of -PRON- science and skill and however much in a flattering future that science and skill may augment yet for ever and for ever to the crack of doom the sea will insult and murder -PRON- and pulverize the stately stiff frigate -PRON- can make nevertheless by the continual repetition of these very impression man have lose that sense of the full awfulness of the sea which aboriginally belong to -PRON-
chapter_58	the first boat -PRON- read of float on an ocean that with portuguese vengeance have whelm a whole world without leave so much as a widow
chapter_58	that same ocean roll now that same ocean destroy the wreck ship of last year
chapter_58	preternatural terror rest upon the hebrews when under the foot of korah and -PRON- company the live ground open and swallow -PRON- up for ever yet not a modern sun ever set but in precisely the same manner the live sea swallow up ship and crew
chapter_58	but not only be the sea such a foe to man who be an alien to -PRON- but -PRON- be also a fiend to -PRON- own off spring bad than the persian host who murder -PRON- own guest spar not the creature which -PRON- hath spawn
chapter_58	like a savage tigress that toss in the jungle overlay -PRON- own cub so the sea dash even the mighty whale against the rock and leave -PRON- there side by side with the split wreck of ship
chapter_58	pant and snort like a mad battle steed that have lose -PRON- rider the masterless ocean overrun the globe
chapter_58	consider the subtleness of the sea how -PRON- most dreaded creature glide under water unapparent for the most part and treacherously hidden beneath the lovely tint of azure
chapter_58	consider also the devilish brilliance and beauty of many of -PRON- most remorseless tribe as the dainty embellish shape of many specie of shark
chapter_58	consider once more the universal cannibalism of the sea all whose creature prey upon each other carry on eternal war since the world begin
chapter_58	consider all this and then turn to this green gentle and most docile earth consider -PRON- both the sea and the land and do -PRON- not find a strange analogy to something in -PRON-
chapter_58	for as this appalling ocean surround the verdant land so in the soul of man there lie one insular tahiti full of peace and joy but encompass by all the horror of the half know life
chapter_58	push not off from that isle thou canst never return
chapter_59	squid
chapter_59	slowly wad through the meadow of brit the pequod still hold on -PRON- way north eastward towards the island of java a gentle air impel -PRON- keel so that in the surround serenity -PRON- three tall taper mast mildly wave to that languid breeze as three mild palm on a plain
chapter_59	and still at wide interval in the silvery night the lonely alluring jet would be see
chapter_59	thus glisten for a moment as slowly -PRON- subside and sink
chapter_59	then once more arise and silently gleam
chapter_59	-PRON- seem not a whale and yet be this moby dick think daggoo
chapter_59	"again the phantom go down but on re appear once more with a stiletto like cry that startle every man from -PRON- nod the negro yell out--""there"
chapter_59	there
chapter_59	-PRON- breach
chapter_59	right ahead
chapter_59	the white whale the white whale
chapter_59	upon this the seaman rush to the yard arm as in swarm time the bee rush to the bough
chapter_59	whether the flit attendance of the one still and solitary jet have gradually work upon ahab so that -PRON- be now prepared to connect the idea of mildness and repose with the first sight of the particular whale -PRON- pursue however this be or whether -PRON- eagerness betray -PRON- whichev way -PRON- may have be no sooner do -PRON- distinctly perceive the white mass than with a quick intensity -PRON- instantly give order for lower
chapter_59	soon -PRON- go down and while with oar suspend -PRON- be await -PRON- reappearance lo in the same spot where -PRON- sink once more -PRON- slowly rise
chapter_59	no perceptible face or front do -PRON- have no conceivable token of either sensation or instinct but undulate there on the billow an unearthly formless chance like apparition of life
chapter_59	what be -PRON- sir say flask
chapter_59	the great live squid which -PRON- say few whale ship ever behold and return to -PRON- port to tell of -PRON-
chapter_59	but ahab say nothing turn -PRON- boat -PRON- sail back to the vessel the rest as silently follow
chapter_59	whatev superstition the sperm whaleman in general have connect with the sight of this object certain -PRON- be that a glimpse of -PRON- be so very unusual that circumstance have go far to invest -PRON- with portentousness
chapter_59	so rarely be -PRON- behold that though one and all of -PRON- declare -PRON- to be the large animate thing in the ocean yet very few of -PRON- have any
chapter_59	but the most vague idea concern -PRON- true nature and form notwithstanding -PRON- believe -PRON- to furnish to the sperm whale -PRON- only food
chapter_59	at time when closely pursue -PRON- will disgorge what be suppose to be the detached arm of the squid some of -PRON- thus exhibit exceed twenty and thirty foot in length
chapter_59	-PRON- fancy that the monster to which these arm belong ordinarily cling by -PRON- to the bed of the ocean and that the sperm whale unlike other specie be supply with tooth in order to attack and tear -PRON-
chapter_59	there seem some ground to imagine that the great kraken of bishop pontoppodan may ultimately resolve -PRON- into squid
chapter_59	the manner in which the bishop describe -PRON- as alternately rise and sink with some other particular -PRON- narrate in all this the two correspond
chapter_59	by some naturalist who have vaguely hear rumor of the mysterious creature here speak of -PRON- be include among the class of cuttle fish to which indeed in certain external respect -PRON- would seem to belong but only as the anak of the tribe
chapter_60	the line
chapter_60	with reference to the whaling scene shortly to be describe as well as for the good understanding of all similar scene elsewhere present -PRON- have here to speak of the magical sometimes horrible whale line
chapter_60	the line originally use in the fishery be of the good hemp slightly vapour with tar not impregnate with -PRON- as in the case of ordinary rope for while tar as ordinarily use make the hemp more pliable to the rope maker and also render the rope -PRON- more convenient to the sailor for common ship use yet not only would the ordinary quantity too much stiffen the whale line for the close coil to which -PRON- must be subject but as most seaman be begin to learn tar in general by no means add to the rope 's durability or strength however much -PRON- may give -PRON- compactness and gloss
chapter_60	of late year the manilla rope have in the american fishery almost entirely supersede hemp as a material for whale line for though not so durable as hemp -PRON- be strong and far more soft and elastic and -PRON- will add since there be an aesthetic in all thing be much more handsome and become to the boat than hemp
chapter_60	the whale line be only two third of an inch in thickness
chapter_60	by experiment -PRON- one and fifty yarn will each suspend a weight of one hundred and twenty pound so that the whole rope will bear a strain nearly equal to three ton
chapter_60	in length the common sperm whale line measure something over two hundred fathom
chapter_60	towards the stern of the boat -PRON- be spirally coil away in the tub not like the worm pipe of a still though
chapter_60	but the heart or minute vertical tube form at the axis of the cheese
chapter_60	as the least tangle or kink in the coil would in run out infallibly take somebody 's arm leg or entire body off the utmost precaution be use in stow the line in -PRON- tub
chapter_60	some harpooneer will consume almost an entire morning in this business carry the line high aloft and then reeve -PRON- downwards through a block towards the tub so as in the act of coil to free -PRON- from all possible wrinkle and twist
chapter_60	in the english boat two tub be use instead of one the same line be continuously coil in both tub
chapter_60	there be some advantage in this because these twin tub be so small -PRON- fit more readily into the boat and do not strain -PRON- so much whereas the american tub nearly three foot in diameter and of proportionate depth make a rather bulky freight for a craft whose plank be but one half inch in thickness for the bottom of the whale boat be like critical ice which will bear up a considerable distribute weight but not very much of a concentrated one
chapter_60	when the paint canvas cover be clap on the american line tub the boat look as if -PRON- be pull off with a prodigious great wedding cake to present to the whale
chapter_60	in these instance the whale of course be shift like a mug of ale as -PRON- be from the one boat to the other though the first boat always hover at hand to assist -PRON- consort
chapter_60	before lower the boat for the chase the upper end of the line be take aft from the tub and pass round the loggerhead there be again carry forward the entire length of the boat rest crosswise upon the loom or handle of every man 's oar so that -PRON- jog against -PRON- wrist in rowing and also pass between the man as -PRON- alternately sit at the opposite gunwale to the leaded chock or groove in the extreme pointed prow of the boat where a wooden pin or skewer the size of a common quill prevent -PRON- from slip out
chapter_60	from the chock -PRON- hang in a slight festoon over the bow and be then pass inside the boat again and some ten or twenty fathom call box line be coil upon the box in the bow -PRON- continue -PRON- way to the gunwale still a little further aft and be then attach to the short warp the rope which be immediately connect with the harpoon but previous to that connexion the short warp go through sundry mystification too tedious to detail
chapter_60	yet habit strange thing
chapter_60	what can not habit accomplish
chapter_60	perhaps a very little thought will now enable -PRON- to account for those repeat whaling disaster some few of which be casually chronicled of this man or that man be take out of the boat by the line and lose
chapter_60	for when the line be dart out to be seat then in the boat be like be seat in the midst of the manifold whizzing of a steam engine in full play when every fly beam and shaft and wheel be graze -PRON-
chapter_60	-PRON- be bad for -PRON- can not sit motionless in the heart of these peril because the boat be rock like a cradle and -PRON- be pitch one way and the other without the slight warning and only by a certain self adjust buoyancy and simultaneousness of volition and action can -PRON- escape be make a mazeppa of and run away with where the all see sun -PRON- could never pierce -PRON- out
chapter_60	again as the profound calm which only apparently precede and prophesie of the storm be perhaps more awful than the storm -PRON- for indeed the calm be but the wrapper and envelope of the storm and contain -PRON- in -PRON- as the seemingly harmless rifle hold the fatal powder and the ball and the explosion so the graceful repose of the line as -PRON- silently serpentin about the oarsman before be bring into actual play this be a thing which carry more of true terror than any other aspect of this dangerous affair
chapter_60	all man live envelop in whale line
chapter_60	and if -PRON- be a philosopher though seat in the whale boat -PRON- would not at heart feel one whit more of terror than though seat before -PRON- evening fire with a poker and not a harpoon by -PRON- side
chapter_61	stubb kill a whale
chapter_61	if to starbuck the apparition of the squid be a thing of portent to queequeg -PRON- be quite a different object
chapter_61	
chapter_61	the next day be exceedingly still and sultry and with nothing special to engage -PRON- the pequod 's crew could hardly resist the spell of sleep induce by such a vacant sea
chapter_61	for this part of the indian ocean through which -PRON- then be voyage be not what whaleman call a lively ground that is -PRON- afford few glimpse of porpoise dolphin fly fish and other vivacious denizen of more stirring water than those off the rio de la plata or the in shore ground off peru
chapter_61	so that at last all three of -PRON- lifelessly swing from the spar and for every swing that -PRON- make there be a nod from below from the slumber helmsman
chapter_61	and lo
chapter_61	but lazily undulate in the trough of the sea and ever and anon tranquilly spout -PRON- vapoury jet the whale look like a portly burgher smoke -PRON- pipe of a warm afternoon
chapter_61	but that pipe poor whale be thy last
chapter_61	clear away the boat
chapter_61	luff cry ahab
chapter_61	and obey -PRON- own order -PRON- dash the helm down before the helmsman could handle the spoke
chapter_61	the sudden exclamation of the crew must have alarm the whale and ere the boat be down majestically turn -PRON- swim away to the leeward but with such a steady tranquillity and make so few ripple as -PRON- swim that think after all -PRON- may not as yet be alarm ahab give order that not an oar should be use and no man must speak but in whisper
chapter_61	so seat like ontario indians on the gunwale of the boat -PRON- swiftly but silently paddle along the calm not admit of the noiseless sail be set
chapter_61	be the cry an announcement immediately follow by stubb 's produce -PRON- match and ignite -PRON- pipe for now a respite be grant
chapter_61	after the full interval of -PRON- sounding have elapse the whale rise again and be now in advance of the smoker 's boat and much nearer to -PRON- than to any of the other stubb count upon the honour of the capture
chapter_61	-PRON- be obvious now that the whale have at length become aware of -PRON- pursuer
chapter_61	all silence of cautiousness be therefore no long of use
chapter_61	paddle be drop and oar come loudly into play
chapter_61	and still puff at -PRON- pipe stubb cheer on -PRON- crew to the assault
chapter_61	
chapter_61	besides such be the breadth of the upper part of the front of -PRON- head and such the taper cut water formation of the low part that by obliquely elevate -PRON- head -PRON- thereby may be say to transform -PRON- from a bluff bow sluggish galliot into a sharppointed new york pilot boat start -PRON- start -PRON- -PRON- man
chapter_61	start -PRON- tash -PRON- boy start -PRON- all but keep cool keep cool cucumber be the word easy easy only start -PRON- like grim death and grin devil and raise the bury dead perpendicular out of -PRON- graf boy that be all
chapter_61	start -PRON-
chapter_61	kee hee
chapter_61	yell daggoo strain forwards and backwards on -PRON- seat like a pacing tiger in -PRON- cage
chapter_61	koo loo
chapter_61	howl queequeg as if smack -PRON- lip over a mouthful of grenadier 's steak
chapter_61	and thus with oar and yell the keel cut the sea
chapter_61	"like desperado -PRON- tug and -PRON- strained till the welcome cry be heard--""stand up tashtego!--give -PRON- to -PRON-"
chapter_61	the harpoon be hurl
chapter_61	the oarsman back water the same moment something go hot and hiss along every one of -PRON- wrist
chapter_61	-PRON- be the magical line
chapter_61	an instant before
chapter_61	the loggerhead whence by reason of -PRON- increase rapid circling a hempen blue smoke now jet up and mingle with the steady fume from -PRON- pipe
chapter_61	wet the line
chapter_61	cry stubb to the tub oarsman -PRON- seat by the tub who snatch off -PRON- hat dash sea water into -PRON-
chapter_61	
chapter_61	more turn be take so that the line begin hold -PRON- place
chapter_61	stubb and tashtego here change place stem for stern a staggering business truly in that rock commotion
chapter_61	partly to show the indispensableness of this act -PRON- may here be state that in the old dutch fishery a mop be use to dash the run line with water in many other ship a wooden piggin or bailer be set apart for that purpose
chapter_61	-PRON- hat however be the most convenient
chapter_61	a continual cascade play at the bow a ceaseless whirl eddy in -PRON- wake and at the slight motion from within even but of a little finger the vibrate crack craft cant over -PRON- spasmodic gunwale into the sea
chapter_61	thus -PRON- rush each man with might and main cling to -PRON- seat to prevent being toss to the foam and the tall form of tashtego at the steering oar crouch almost double in order to bring down -PRON- centre of gravity
chapter_61	whole atlantic and pacifics seem pass as -PRON- shoot on -PRON- way till at length the whale somewhat slacken -PRON- flight
chapter_61	the slant sun playing upon this crimson pond in the sea send back -PRON- reflection into every face so that -PRON- all glow to each other like red man
chapter_61	and all the while jet after jet of white smoke be agonizingly shoot from the spiracle of the whale and vehement puff after puff from the mouth of the excited headsman as at every dart hauling in upon -PRON- crooked lance by the line attach to -PRON- stubb straighten -PRON- again and again by a few rapid blow against the gunwale then again and again send -PRON- into the whale
chapter_61	-PRON- now cry to the bowsman as the wan whale relaxed in -PRON- wrath
chapter_61	and the boat range along the fish 's flank
chapter_61	when reach far over the bow stubb slowly churn -PRON- long sharp lance into the fish and keep -PRON- there carefully churn and churn as if cautiously seek to feel after some gold watch that the whale may have swallow and which -PRON- be fearful of break ere -PRON- could hook -PRON- out
chapter_61	but that gold watch -PRON- seek be the innermost life of the fish
chapter_61	and now -PRON- be strike for start from -PRON- trance into that unspeakable thing call -PRON- flurry the monster horribly wallow in -PRON- blood overwrapp -PRON- in impenetrable mad boil spray so that the imperilled craft instantly drop astern have much ado blindly to struggle out from that phrensi twilight into the clear air of the day
chapter_61	and now abate in -PRON- flurry the whale once more roll out into view surge from side to side spasmodically dilate and contract -PRON- spout hole with sharp crack agonized respiration
chapter_61	at last gush after gush of clotted red gore as if -PRON- have be the purple lee of red wine shoot into the fright air and fall back again run drip down -PRON- motionless flank into the sea
chapter_61	-PRON- heart have burst
chapter_61	-PRON- be dead mr. stubb say daggoo yes both pipe smoke out
chapter_61	and withdraw -PRON- own from -PRON- mouth stubb scatter the dead ash over the water and for a moment stand thoughtfully eye the vast corpse -PRON- have make
chapter_62	a word concern an incident in the last chapter
chapter_62	accord to the invariable usage of the fishery the whale boat push off from the ship with the headsman or whale killer as temporary steersman and the harpooneer or whale fastener pull the foremost oar the one know as the harpooneer oar
chapter_62	now -PRON- need a strong nervous arm to strike the first iron into the fish for often in what be call a long dart the heavy implement have to be flung to the distance of twenty or thirty foot
chapter_62	but however prolong and exhaust the chase the harpooneer be expect to pull -PRON- oar meanwhile to the uttermost indeed -PRON- be expect to set an example of superhuman activity to the rest not only by incredible rowing but by repeat loud and intrepid exclamation and what -PRON- be to keep shout at the top of one 's compass while all the other muscle be strain and half start what that be
chapter_62	none know but those who have try -PRON-
chapter_62	for one -PRON- can not bawl very heartily and work very recklessly at one and the same time
chapter_62	"in this strain bawl state then with -PRON- back to the fish all at once the exhausted harpooneer hear the exciting cry--""stand up and give -PRON- to -PRON-"
chapter_62	-PRON- now have to drop and secure -PRON- oar turn round on -PRON- centre half way seize -PRON- harpoon from the crotch and with what little strength may remain -PRON- essay to pitch -PRON- somehow into the whale
chapter_62	no wonder take the whole fleet of whaleman in a body that out of fifty fair chance for a dart not five be successful no wonder that so many hapless harpooneer be madly cursed and disrat no wonder that some of -PRON- actually burst -PRON- blood vessel in the boat no wonder that some sperm whaleman be absent four year with four barrel no wonder that to many ship owner whaling be but a lose concern for -PRON- be the harpooneer that make the voyage and if -PRON- take the breath out of -PRON- body how can -PRON- expect to find -PRON- there when most want
chapter_62	again if the dart be successful then at the second critical instant that is when the whale start to run the boatheader and harpooneer likewise start to run fore and aft to the imminent jeopardy of -PRON- and every one else
chapter_62	-PRON- be then -PRON- change place and the headsman the chief officer of the little craft take -PRON- proper station in the bow of the boat
chapter_62	now -PRON- care not who maintain the contrary but all this be both foolish and unnecessary
chapter_62	the headsman should stay in the bow from first to last -PRON- should both dart the harpoon and the lance and no rowing whatev should be expect of -PRON- except under circumstance obvious to any fisherman
chapter_62	to insure the great efficiency in the dart the harpooneer of this world must start to -PRON- foot from out of idleness and not from out of toil
chapter_63	out of the trunk the branch grow out of -PRON- the twig
chapter_63	so in productive subject grow the chapter
chapter_63	-PRON- be a notched stick of a peculiar form some two foot in length which be perpendicularly insert into the starboard gunwale near the bow for the purpose of furnish a rest for the wooden extremity of the harpoon whose other naked barbed end slopingly project from the prow
chapter_63	but these two harpoon each by -PRON- own cord be both connect with the line the object be this to dart -PRON- both if possible one instantly after the other into the same whale so that if in the come drag one should draw out the other may still retain a hold
chapter_63	-PRON- be a doubling of the chance
chapter_63	nevertheless as the second iron be already connect with the line and the line be run hence that weapon must at all event be anticipatingly toss out of the boat somehow and somewhere else the most terrible jeopardy would involve all hand
chapter_63	tumble into the water -PRON- accordingly be in such case the spare coil of box line mention in a precede chapter make this feat in most instance prudently practicable
chapter_63	furthermore -PRON- must know that when the second iron be throw overboard -PRON- thenceforth become a dangling sharp edge terror skittishly curvet about both boat and whale entangle the line or cut -PRON- and make a prodigious sensation in all direction
chapter_63	nor in general be -PRON- possible to secure -PRON- again until the whale be fairly capture and a corpse
chapter_63	consider now how -PRON- must be in the case of four boat all engage one unusually strong active and know whale when owe to these quality in -PRON- as well as to the thousand concur accident of such an audacious enterprise eight or ten loose second iron may be simultaneously dangle about -PRON-
chapter_63	all these particular be faithfully narrate here as -PRON- will not fail to elucidate several most important however intricate passage in scene hereafter to be paint
chapter_64	stubb 's whale have be kill some distance from the ship
chapter_64	-PRON- be a calm so form a tandem of three boat -PRON- commence the slow business of tow the trophy to the pequod
chapter_64	and now as -PRON- eighteen man with -PRON- thirty six arm and one hundred and eighty thumb and finger slowly toil hour after hour upon that inert sluggish corpse in the sea and -PRON- seem hardly to budge at all except at long interval good evidence be hereby furnish of the enormousness of the mass -PRON- move
chapter_64	for upon the great canal of hang ho or whatev -PRON- call -PRON- in china four or five laborer on the foot path will draw a bulky freight junk at the rate of a mile an hour but this grand argosy -PRON- tow heavily forge along as if laden with pig lead in bulk
chapter_64	vacantly eye the heave whale for a moment -PRON- issue the usual order for secure -PRON- for the night and then hand -PRON- lantern to a seaman go -PRON- way into the cabin and do not come forward again until morning
chapter_64	though in oversee the pursuit of this whale captain ahab have evince -PRON- customary activity to call -PRON- so yet now that the creature be dead some vague dissatisfaction or impatience or despair seem work in -PRON- as if the sight of that dead body remind -PRON- that moby dick be yet to be slay and though a thousand other whale be bring to -PRON- ship all that would not one jot advance -PRON- grand monomaniac object
chapter_64	very soon -PRON- would have think from the sound on the pequod 's deck that all hand be prepare to cast anchor in the deep for heavy chain be be drag along the deck and thrust rattle out of the port hole
chapter_64	tie by the head to the stern and by the tail to the bow the whale now lie with -PRON- black hull close to the vessel 's and see through the darkness of the night which obscure the spar and rigging aloft the two ship and whale seem yoke together like colossal bullock whereof one recline while the other remain stand
chapter_64	
chapter_64	the strong and most reliable hold which the ship have upon the whale when moor alongside be by the fluke or tail and as from -PRON- great density that part be relatively heavy than any other except the side fin -PRON- flexibility even in death cause -PRON- to sink low beneath the surface so that with the hand -PRON- can not get at -PRON- from the boat in order to put the chain round -PRON-
chapter_64	but this difficulty be ingeniously overcome a small strong line be prepare with a wooden float at -PRON- outer end and a weight in -PRON- middle while the other end be secure to the ship
chapter_64	by adroit management the wooden float be make to rise on the other side of the mass so that now have girdle the whale the chain be readily make to follow suit and being slip along the body be at last lock fast round the small part of the tail at the point of junction with -PRON- broad fluke or lobe
chapter_64	such an unwonted bustle be -PRON- in that the staid starbuck -PRON- official superior quietly resign to -PRON- for the time the sole management of affair
chapter_64	stubb be a high liver -PRON- be somewhat intemperately fond of the whale as a flavorish thing to -PRON- palate
chapter_64	a steak a steak ere -PRON- sleep
chapter_64	-PRON- daggoo
chapter_64	overboard -PRON- go and cut -PRON- one from -PRON- small
chapter_64	here be -PRON- know that though these wild fisherman do not as a general thing and accord to the great military maxim make the enemy defray the current expense of the war at least before realize the proceed of the voyage yet now and then -PRON- find some of these nantucketers who have a genuine relish for that particular part of the sperm whale designate by stubb comprise the taper extremity of the body
chapter_64	about midnight that steak be cut and cook and light by two lantern of sperm oil stubb stoutly stand up to -PRON- spermaceti supper at the capstan head as if that capstan be a sideboard
chapter_64	nor be stubb the only banqueter on whale 's flesh that night
chapter_64	mingling -PRON- mumbling with -PRON- own mastication thousand on thousand of shark swarm round the dead leviathan smackingly feast on -PRON- fatness
chapter_64	the few sleeper below in -PRON- bunk be often startled by the sharp slapping of -PRON- tail against the hull within a few inch of the sleeper heart
chapter_64	this particular feat of the shark seem all but miraculous
chapter_64	how at such an apparently unassailable surface -PRON- contrive to gouge out such symmetrical mouthful remain a part of the universal problem of all thing
chapter_64	though amid all the smoking horror and diabolism of a sea fight shark will be see longingly gaze up to the ship 's deck like hungry dog round a table where red meat be be carve ready to bolt down every kill man that be toss to -PRON- and though while the valiant butcher over the deck table be thus cannibally carve each other 's live meat with carve knife all gild and tasselled the shark also with -PRON- jewel hilt mouth be quarrelsomely carve away under the table at the dead meat and though be -PRON- to turn the whole affair upside down -PRON- would still be pretty much the same thing that be to say a shocking sharkish business enough for all party and though shark also be the invariable outrider of all slave ship cross the atlantic systematically trot alongside to be handy in case a parcel be to be carry anywhere or a dead slave to be decently bury and though one or two other like instance may be set down touch the set term place and occasion when shark do most socially congregate and most hilariously feast yet be there no conceivable time or occasion when -PRON- will find -PRON- in such countless number and in gay or more jovial spirit than around a dead sperm whale moor by night to a whaleship at sea
chapter_64	but as yet stubb heed not the mumbling of the banquet that be go on so nigh -PRON- no more than the shark heed the smacking of -PRON- own epicurean lip
chapter_64	cook cook!--where be that old fleece
chapter_64	the old black not in any very high glee at have be previously rouse from -PRON- warm hammock at a most unseasonable hour come shamble along from -PRON- galley for like many old black there be something the matter with -PRON- knee pan which -PRON- do not keep well scour like -PRON- other pan this old fleece as -PRON- call -PRON- come shuffle and limp along assist -PRON- step with -PRON- tong which after a clumsy fashion be make of straighten iron hoop this old ebony flounder along and in obedience to the word of command come to a dead stop on the opposite side of stubb 's sideboard when with both hand fold before -PRON- and rest on -PRON- two legged cane -PRON- bow -PRON- arched back still further over at the same time sideways incline -PRON- head so as to bring -PRON- good ear into play
chapter_64	cook say stubb rapidly lift a rather reddish morsel to -PRON- mouth do not -PRON- think this steak be rather overdone
chapter_64	-PRON- have be beat this steak too much cook -PRON- be too tender

chapter_64	away cook and deliver -PRON- message
chapter_64	sullenly take the offer lantern old fleece limp across the deck to the bulwark and then with one hand drop -PRON- light low over the sea so as to get a good view of -PRON- congregation with the other hand -PRON- solemnly flourish -PRON- tong and lean far over the side in a mumbling voice begin address the shark while stubb softly crawl behind overhear all that be say

chapter_64	main top eh do not say dat t'all say fleece again in the sulk
chapter_64	-PRON- say up there do not -PRON-
chapter_64	and now look -PRON- and see where -PRON- tong be point
chapter_64	-PRON- be a ticklish business but must be do or else -PRON- be no go

chapter_64	-PRON- now -PRON- have -PRON-
chapter_64	hold -PRON- there now and pay attention
chapter_64	
chapter_64	all dention say the old black with both hand place as desire vainly wriggle -PRON- grizzled head as if to get both ear in front at one and the same time
chapter_64	well then cook -PRON- see this whale steak of -PRON- be so very bad that -PRON- have put -PRON- out of sight as soon as possible -PRON- see that do not -PRON-
chapter_64	well for the future when -PRON- cook another whale steak for -PRON- private table here the capstan -PRON- will tell -PRON- what to do so as not to spoil -PRON- by overdo
chapter_64	and now to morrow cook when -PRON- be cut in the fish be sure -PRON- stand by to get the tip of -PRON- fin have -PRON- put in pickle
chapter_64	as for the end of the fluke have -PRON- souse cook
chapter_64	there now ye may go
chapter_64	but fleece have hardly get three pace off when -PRON- be recall
chapter_64	d'ye hear
chapter_64	away -PRON- sail then
chapter_64	halloa stop make a bow before -PRON- go
chapter_64	avast heave again
chapter_64	whale ball for breakfast don't forget
chapter_64	wish by gor
chapter_64	whale eat -PRON- stead of -PRON- eat whale
chapter_64	-PRON- be bress if -PRON- be not more of shark dan massa shark hisself mutter the old man limp away with which sage ejaculation -PRON- go to -PRON- hammock
chapter_65	the whale as a dish
chapter_65	that mortal man should feed upon the creature that feed -PRON- lamp and like stubb eat -PRON- by -PRON- own light as -PRON- may say this seem so outlandish a thing that one must need go a little into the history and philosophy of -PRON-
chapter_65	porpoise indeed be to this day consider fine eating
chapter_65	the meat be make into ball about the size of billiard ball and be well seasoned and spice may be take for turtle ball or veal ball
chapter_65	the old monk of dunfermline be very fond of -PRON-
chapter_65	-PRON- have a great porpoise grant from the crown
chapter_65	the fact be that among -PRON- hunter at least the whale would by all hand be consider a noble dish be there not so much of -PRON- but when -PRON- come to sit down before a meat pie nearly one hundred foot long -PRON- take away -PRON- appetite
chapter_65	-PRON- all know how -PRON- live upon whale and have rare old vintage of prime old train oil
chapter_65	and this remind -PRON- that certain englishmen who long ago be accidentally leave in greenland by a whaling vessel that these man actually live for several month on the mouldy scrap of whale which have be leave ashore after try out the blubber
chapter_65	-PRON- have such an eatable look that the most self deny stranger can hardly keep -PRON- hand off
chapter_65	but what further depreciate the whale as a civilized dish be -PRON- exceed richness
chapter_65	-PRON- be the great prize ox of the sea too fat to be delicately good
chapter_65	nevertheless many whaleman have a method of absorb -PRON- into some other substance and then partake of -PRON-
chapter_65	in the long try watch of the night -PRON- be a common thing for the seaman to dip -PRON- ship biscuit into the huge oil pot and let -PRON- fry there awhile
chapter_65	many a good supper have -PRON- thus make
chapter_65	in the case of a small sperm whale the brain be account a fine dish
chapter_65	the casket of the skull be break into with an axe and the two plump whitish lobe be withdraw precisely resemble two large pudding -PRON- be then mixed with flour and cook into a most delectable mess in flavor somewhat resemble calf head which be quite a dish among some epicure and every one know that some young buck among the epicure by continually din upon calf brain by and by get to have a little brain of -PRON- own so as to be able to tell a calf 's head from -PRON- own head which indeed require uncommon discrimination
chapter_65	and that be the reason why a young buck with an intelligent look calf 's head before -PRON- be somehow one of the sad sight -PRON- can see
chapter_65	the head look a sort of reproachfully at -PRON- with an et tu brute expression
chapter_65	-PRON- be not perhaps entirely because the whale be so excessively unctuous that landsman seem to regard the eating of -PRON- with abhorrence that appear to result in some way from the consideration before mention i.e. that a man should eat a newly murder thing of the sea and eat -PRON- too by -PRON- own light
chapter_65	but no doubt the first man that ever murder an ox be regard as a murderer perhaps -PRON- be hang and if -PRON- have be put on -PRON- trial by oxen -PRON- certainly would have be and -PRON- certainly deserve -PRON- if any murderer do
chapter_65	go to the meat market of a saturday night and see the crowd of live biped star up at the long row of dead quadruped
chapter_65	do not that sight take a tooth out of the cannibal 's jaw
chapter_65	cannibal who be not a cannibal
chapter_65	and that be add insult to injury be -PRON-
chapter_65	and what do -PRON- pick -PRON- tooth with after devour that fat goose
chapter_65	with a feather of the same fowl
chapter_65	-PRON- be only within the last month or two that that society pass a resolution to patronise nothing but steel pen
chapter_66	the shark massacre
chapter_66	when in the southern fishery a capture sperm whale after long and weary toil be bring alongside late at night -PRON- be not as a general thing at least customary to proceed at once to the business of cut -PRON- in
chapter_66	for that business be an exceedingly laborious one be not very soon complete and require all hand to set about -PRON-
chapter_66	but sometimes especially upon the line in the pacific this plan will not answer at all because such incalculable host of shark gather round the moored carcase that be -PRON- leave so for six hour say on a stretch little more than the skeleton would be visible by morning
chapter_66	in most other part of the ocean however where these fish do not so largely abound -PRON- wondrous voracity can be at time considerably diminish by vigorously stir -PRON- up with sharp whaling spade a procedure notwithstanding which in some instance only seem to tickle -PRON- into still great activity
chapter_66	but -PRON- be not thus in the present case with the pequod 's shark though to be sure any man unaccustomed to such sight to have look over -PRON- side that night would have almost think the whole round sea be one huge cheese and those shark the maggot in -PRON-
chapter_66	but in the foamy confusion of -PRON- mixed and struggle host the marksman could not always hit -PRON- mark and this bring about new revelation of the incredible ferocity of the foe
chapter_66	-PRON- viciously snap not only at each other 's disembowelment but like flexible bow bent round and bite -PRON- own till those entrail seem swallow over and over again by the same mouth to be oppositely void by the gap wound
chapter_66	-PRON- be unsafe to meddle with the corps and ghost of these creature
chapter_66	a sort of generic or pantheistic vitality seem to lurk in -PRON- very joint and bone after what may be call the individual life have depart
chapter_66	kill and hoist on deck for the sake of -PRON- skin one of these shark almost take poor queequeg 's hand off when -PRON- try to shut down the dead lid of -PRON- murderous jaw
chapter_66	this weapon be always keep as sharp as possible and when be use be occasionally hone just like a razor
chapter_66	in -PRON- socket a stiff pole from twenty to thirty foot long be insert for a handle
chapter_66	queequeg no care what god make -PRON- shark say the savage agonizingly lift -PRON- hand up and down wedder fejee god or nantucket god but de god wat make shark must be one dam ingin
chapter_67	cut
chapter_67	in
chapter_67	ex officio professor of sabbath break be all whaleman
chapter_67	in the first place the enormous cutting tackle among other ponderous thing comprise a cluster of block generally paint green and which no single man can possibly lift this vast bunch of grape be sway up to the main top and firmly lash to the low mast head the strong point anywhere above a ship 's deck
chapter_67	and now suspend in stage over the side starbuck and stubb the mate arm with -PRON- long spade begin cut a hole in the body for the insertion of the hook just above the near of the two side fin
chapter_67	when instantly the entire ship careen over on -PRON- side every bolt in -PRON- start like the nail head of an old house in frosty weather -PRON- tremble quiver and nod -PRON- fright mast head to the sky
chapter_67	more and more -PRON- lean over to the whale while every gasping heave of the windlass be answer by a help heave from the billow till at last a swift startling snap be hear with a great swash the ship roll upwards and backwards from the whale and the triumphant tackle rise into sight dragging after -PRON- the disengage semicircular end of the first strip of blubber
chapter_67	for the strain constantly keep up by the windlass continually keep the whale roll over and over in the water and as the blubber in one strip uniformly peel off along the line call the scarf simultaneously cut by the spade of starbuck and stubb the mate and just as fast as -PRON- be thus peel off and indeed by that very act -PRON- -PRON- be all the time be hoist high and high aloft till -PRON- upper end graze the main top the man at the windlass then cease heaving and for a moment or two the prodigious blood drip mass sway to and fro as if let down from the sky and every one present must take good heed to dodge -PRON- when -PRON- swing else -PRON- may box -PRON- ear and pitch -PRON- headlong overboard
chapter_67	one of the attend harpooneer now advance with a long keen weapon call a boarding sword and watch -PRON- chance -PRON- dexterously slice out a considerable hole in the low part of the sway mass
chapter_67	whereupon this accomplished swordsman warn all hand to stand off once more make a scientific dash at the mass and with a few sidelong desperate lunging slicing sever -PRON- completely in twain so that while the short low part be still fast the long upper strip call a blanket piece swing clear and be all ready for lower
chapter_67	the heaver forward now resume -PRON- song and while the one tackle be peeling and hoist a second strip from the whale the other be slowly slacken away and down go the first strip through the main hatchway right beneath into an unfurnished parlor call the blubber room
chapter_67	and thus the work proceed the two tackle hoisting and lower simultaneously both whale and windlass heaving the heaver sing the blubber room gentleman coil the mate scarf the ship strain and all hand swear occasionally by way of assuage the general friction
chapter_68	-PRON- have give no small attention to that not unvex subject the skin of the whale
chapter_68	-PRON- have have controversy about -PRON- with experienced whaleman afloat and learn naturalist ashore
chapter_68	-PRON- original opinion remain unchanged but -PRON- be only an opinion
chapter_68	the question be what and where be the skin of the whale
chapter_68	already -PRON- know what -PRON- blubber be
chapter_68	now however preposterous -PRON- may at first seem to talk of any creature 's skin as be of that sort of consistence and thickness yet in point of fact these be no argument against such a presumption because -PRON- can not raise any other dense enveloping layer from the whale 's body but that same blubber and the outermost enveloping layer of any animal if reasonably dense what can that be but the skin
chapter_68	true from the unmarred dead body of the whale -PRON- may scrape off with -PRON- hand an infinitely thin transparent substance somewhat resemble the thin shred of isinglass only -PRON- be almost as flexible and soft as satin that is previous to be dry when -PRON- not only contract and thicken but become rather hard and brittle
chapter_68	at any rate -PRON- be pleasant to read about whale through -PRON- own spectacle as -PRON- may say
chapter_68	that same infinitely thin isinglass substance which -PRON- admit invest the entire body of the whale be not so much to be regard as the skin of the creature as the skin of the skin so to speak for -PRON- be simply ridiculous to say that the proper skin of the tremendous whale be thin and more tender than the skin of a new bear child
chapter_68	but no more of this
chapter_68	assume the blubber to be the skin of the whale then when this skin as in the case of a very large sperm whale will yield the bulk of one hundred barrel of oil and when -PRON- be consider that in quantity or rather weight that oil in -PRON- express state be only three fourth and not the entire substance of the coat some idea may hence be have of the enormousness of that animate mass a mere part of whose mere integument yield such a lake of liquid as that
chapter_68	reckoning ten barrel to the ton -PRON- have ten ton for the net weight of only three quarter of the stuff of the whale 's skin
chapter_68	in life the visible surface of the sperm whale be not the least among the many marvel -PRON- present
chapter_68	almost invariably -PRON- be all over obliquely cross and re cross with numberless straight mark in thick array something like those in the fine italian line engraving
chapter_68	but these mark do not seem to be impressed upon the isinglass substance above mention but seem to be see through -PRON- as if -PRON- be engrave upon the body -PRON-
chapter_68	nor be this all
chapter_68	in some instance to the quick observant eye those linear mark as in a veritable engraving but afford the ground for far other delineation
chapter_68	these be hieroglyphical that is if -PRON- call those mysterious cypher on the wall of pyramid hieroglyphic then that be the proper word to use in the present connexion
chapter_68	by -PRON- retentive memory of the hieroglyphic upon one sperm whale in particular -PRON- be much strike with a plate represent the old indian character chisel on the famous hieroglyphic palisade on the bank of the upper mississippi
chapter_68	like those mystic rock too the mystic marked whale remain undecipherable
chapter_68	besides all the other phenomenon which the exterior of the sperm whale present -PRON- not seldom display the back and more especially -PRON- flank efface in great part of the regular linear appearance by reason of numerous rude scratch altogether of an irregular random aspect
chapter_68	-PRON- also seem to -PRON- that such scratch in the whale be probably make by hostile contact with other whale for -PRON- have most remark -PRON- in the large full grow bull of the species
chapter_68	-PRON- have already be say that -PRON- be stript from -PRON- in long piece call blanket piece
chapter_68	like most sea term this one be very happy and significant
chapter_68	for the whale be indeed wrapt up in -PRON- blubber as in a real blanket or counterpane or still good an indian poncho slipt over -PRON- head and skirt -PRON- extremity
chapter_68	-PRON- be by reason of this cosy blanketing of -PRON- body that the whale be enable to keep -PRON- comfortable in all weather in all sea time and tide
chapter_68	true other fish be find exceedingly brisk in those hyperborean water but these be -PRON- observe be -PRON- cold blooded lungless fish whose very belly be refrigerator creature that warm -PRON- under the lee of an iceberg as a traveller in winter would bask before an inn fire whereas like man the whale have lung and warm blood
chapter_68	how wonderful be -PRON- then except after explanation that this great monster to whom corporeal warmth be as indispensable as -PRON- be to man how wonderful that -PRON- should be find at home immerse to -PRON- lip for life in those arctic water
chapter_68	but more surprising be -PRON- to know as have be prove by experiment that the blood of a polar whale be warm than that of a borneo negro in summer
chapter_68	-PRON- do seem to -PRON- that herein -PRON- see the rare virtue of a strong individual vitality and the rare virtue of thick wall and the rare virtue of interior spaciousness
chapter_68	oh man admire and model thyself after the whale
chapter_68	be cool at the equator keep thy blood fluid at the pole
chapter_68	but how easy and how hopeless to teach these fine thing
chapter_68	of erection how few be domed like st. peter 's of creature
chapter_68	how few vast as the whale
chapter_69	the funeral haul in the chain
chapter_69	let the carcase go astern
chapter_69	the vast tackle have now do -PRON- duty
chapter_69	the peel white body of the behead whale flash like a marble sepulchre though change in hue -PRON- have not perceptibly lose anything in bulk
chapter_69	-PRON- be still colossal
chapter_69	slowly -PRON- float more and more away the water round -PRON- torn and splash by the insatiate shark and the air above vexed with rapacious flight of scream fowl whose beak be like so many insulting poniard in the whale
chapter_69	the vast white headless phantom float further and further from the ship and every rod that -PRON- so float what seem square rood of shark and cubic rood of fowl augment the murderous din
chapter_69	there be a most doleful and most mock funeral
chapter_69	in life but few of -PRON- would have help the whale -PRON- ween if peradventure -PRON- have need -PRON- but upon the banquet of -PRON- funeral -PRON- most piously do pounce
chapter_69	oh horrible vultureism of earth
chapter_69	nor be this the end
chapter_69	desecrate as the body be a vengeful ghost survive and hover over -PRON- to scare
chapter_69	and for year afterwards perhaps ship shun the place leap over -PRON- as silly sheep leap over a vacuum because -PRON- leader originally leap there when a stick be hold
chapter_69	there be -PRON- law of precedent there be -PRON- utility of tradition there be the story of -PRON- obstinate survival of old belief never bottom on the earth and now not even hover in the air
chapter_69	be -PRON- a believer in ghost -PRON- friend
chapter_69	there be other ghost than the cock lane one and far deep man than doctor johnson who believe in -PRON-
chapter_70	-PRON- should not have be omit that previous to completely strip the body of the leviathan -PRON- be behead
chapter_70	now the beheading of the sperm whale be a scientific anatomical feat upon which experience whale surgeon very much pride -PRON- and not without reason
chapter_70	consider that the whale have nothing that can properly be call a neck on the contrary where -PRON- head and body seem to join there in that very place be the thick part of -PRON-
chapter_70	bear in mind too that under these untoward circumstance -PRON- have to cut many foot deep in the flesh and in that subterraneous manner without so much as get one single peep into the ever contracting gash thus make -PRON- must skilfully steer clear of all adjacent interdicted part and exactly divide the spine at a critical point hard by -PRON- insertion into the skull
chapter_70	do -PRON- not marvel then at stubb 's boast that -PRON- demand but ten minute to behead a sperm whale
chapter_70	when first sever the head be drop astern and hold there by a cable till the body be strip
chapter_70	that do if -PRON- belong to a small whale -PRON- be hoist on deck to be deliberately dispose of
chapter_70	and there with the strained craft steeply lean over to -PRON- by reason of the enormous downward drag from the low mast head and every yard arm on that side project like a crane over the wave there that blood drip head hang to the pequod 's waist like the giant holofernes 's from the girdle of judith
chapter_70	when this last task be accomplish -PRON- be noon and the seaman go below to -PRON- dinner
chapter_70	an intense copper calm like a universal yellow lotus be more and more unfold -PRON- noiseless measureless leaf upon the sea
chapter_70	a short space elapse and up into this noiselessness come ahab alone from -PRON- cabin
chapter_70	take a few turn on the quarter deck -PRON- pause to gaze over the side then slowly get into the main chain -PRON- take stubb 's long spade still remain there after the whale 's decapitation and strike -PRON- into the low part of the half suspend mass place -PRON- other end crutch wise under one arm and so stand lean over with eye attentively fix on this head
chapter_70	speak thou vast and venerable head mutter ahab which though ungarnished with a beard yet here and there lookest hoary with moss speak mighty head and tell -PRON- the secret thing that be in thee
chapter_70	of all diver thou hast dive the deep
chapter_70	that head upon which the upper sun now gleam have move amid this world 's foundation
chapter_70	thou hast be where bell or diver never go hast sleep by many a sailor 's side where sleepless mother would give -PRON- life to lay -PRON- down
chapter_70	thou saw'st the lock lover when leap from -PRON- flaming ship heart to heart -PRON- sink beneath the exult wave true to each other when heaven seem false to -PRON-
chapter_70	thou saw'st the murder mate when toss by pirate from the midnight deck for hour -PRON- fall into the deep midnight of the insatiate maw and -PRON- murderer still sail on unharmed while swift lightning shiver the neighboring ship that would have bear a righteous husband to outstretched longing arm
chapter_70	o head
chapter_70	
chapter_70	sail ho
chapter_70	cry a triumphant voice from the main mast head
chapter_70	aye
chapter_70	well now that be cheer cry ahab suddenly erect -PRON- while whole thunder cloud sweep aside from -PRON- brow
chapter_70	that lively cry upon this deadly calm may almost convert a good man
chapter_70	where away
chapter_70	three point on the starboard bow sir and bring down -PRON- breeze to -PRON-
chapter_70	would now st. paul would come along that way and to -PRON- breezelessness bring -PRON- breeze
chapter_70	o nature and o soul of man
chapter_70	how far beyond all utterance be -PRON- link analogy
chapter_70	not the small atom stir or life on matter but have -PRON- cunning duplicate in mind
chapter_70	
chapter_71	the jeroboam 's story
chapter_71	hand in hand ship and breeze blow on but the breeze come faster than the ship and soon the pequod begin to rock
chapter_71	by and by through the glass the stranger 's boat and manned mast head prove -PRON- a whale ship
chapter_71	but as -PRON- be so far to windward and shoot by apparently make a passage to some other ground the pequod could not hope to reach -PRON-
chapter_71	so the signal be set to see what response would be make
chapter_71	thereby the whale commander be enable to recognise each other upon the ocean even at considerable distance and with no small facility
chapter_71	the pequod 's signal be at last respond to by the stranger 's set -PRON- own which prove the ship to be the jeroboam of nantucket
chapter_71	square -PRON- yard -PRON- bear down range abeam under the pequod 's lee and lower a boat -PRON- soon draw nigh but as the side ladder be be rig by starbuck 's order to accommodate the visit captain the stranger in question wave -PRON- hand from -PRON- boat 's stern in token of that proceed be entirely unnecessary
chapter_71	-PRON- turn out that the jeroboam have a malignant epidemic on board and that mayhew -PRON- captain be fearful of infect the pequod 's company
chapter_71	for though -PRON- and boat 's crew remain untainted and though -PRON- ship be half a rifle shoot off and an incorruptible sea and air rolling and flow between yet conscientiously adhere to the timid quarantine of the land -PRON- peremptorily refuse to come into direct contact with the pequod
chapter_71	preserve an interval of some few yard between -PRON- and the ship the jeroboam 's boat by the occasional use of -PRON- oar contrive to keep parallel to the pequod as -PRON- heavily forge through the sea for by this time -PRON- blow very fresh with -PRON- main topsail aback though indeed at time by the sudden onset of a large rolling wave the boat would be push some way ahead but would be soon skilfully bring to -PRON- proper bearing again
chapter_71	-PRON- be a small short youngish man sprinkle all over -PRON- face with freckle and wear redundant yellow hair
chapter_71	a long skirt cabalistically cut coat of a faded walnut tinge envelop -PRON- the overlapping sleeve of which be roll up on -PRON- wrist
chapter_71	a deep settle fanatic delirium be in -PRON- eye
chapter_71	"exclaimed--""that be -PRON-"
chapter_71	stubb here allude to a strange story tell of the jeroboam and a certain man among -PRON- crew some time previous when the pequod speak the town ho
chapter_71	accord to this account and what be subsequently learn -PRON- seem that the scaramouch in question have gain a wonderful ascendency over almost everybody in the jeroboam
chapter_71	-PRON- story be this -PRON- have be originally nurture among the crazy society of neskyeuna shakers where -PRON- have be a great prophet in -PRON- crack secret meeting have several time descend from heaven by the way of a trap door announce the speedy opening of the seventh vial which -PRON- carry in -PRON- vest pocket but which instead of contain gunpowder be suppose to be charge with laudanum
chapter_71	a strange apostolic whim have seize -PRON- -PRON- have leave neskyeuna for nantucket where with that cunning peculiar to craziness -PRON- assume a steady common sense exterior and offer -PRON- as a green hand candidate for the jeroboam 's whaling voyage
chapter_71	-PRON- announce -PRON- as the archangel gabriel and command the captain to jump overboard
chapter_71	-PRON- publish -PRON- manifesto whereby -PRON- set -PRON- forth as the deliverer of the isle of the sea and vicar general of all oceanica
chapter_71	-PRON- be therefore force to relinquish -PRON- plan
chapter_71	nor would -PRON- permit gabriel to be any way maltreat say or do what -PRON- would so that -PRON- come to pass that gabriel have the complete freedom of the ship
chapter_71	nor be the history of fanatic half so strike in respect to the measureless self deception of the fanatic -PRON- as -PRON- measureless power of deceive and bedevil so many other
chapter_71	but now gabriel start to -PRON- foot
chapter_71	think think of the fever yellow and bilious
chapter_71	beware of the horrible plague
chapter_71	gabriel
chapter_71	gabriel cry captain mayhew thou must either--
chapter_71	but that instant a headlong wave shoot the boat far ahead and -PRON- seething drown all speech
chapter_71	hast thou see the white whale
chapter_71	demand ahab when the boat drift back
chapter_71	think think of thy whale boat stoven and sink
chapter_71	-PRON- tell thee again gabriel that--
chapter_71	but again the boat tear ahead as if drag by fiend
chapter_71	when this interlude be over captain mayhew begin a dark story concern moby dick not however without frequent interruption from gabriel whenever -PRON- name be mention and the crazy sea that seem league with -PRON-
chapter_71	-PRON- seem that the jeroboam have not long leave home when upon speak a whale ship -PRON- people be reliably apprise of the existence of moby dick and the havoc -PRON- have make
chapter_71	greedily suck in this intelligence gabriel solemnly warn the captain against attack the white whale in case the monster should be see in -PRON- gibbering insanity pronounce the white whale to be no less a be than the shaker god incarnate the shaker receive the bible
chapter_71	but when some year or two afterwards moby dick be fairly sight from the mast head macey the chief mate burn with ardour to encounter -PRON- and the captain -PRON- be not unwilling to let -PRON- have the opportunity despite all the archangel 's denunciation and forewarning macey succeed in persuade five man to man -PRON- boat
chapter_71	with -PRON- -PRON- push off and after much weary pulling and many perilous unsuccessful onset -PRON- at last succeed in get one iron fast
chapter_71	now while macey the mate be stand up in -PRON- boat 's bow and with all the reckless energy of -PRON- tribe be vent -PRON- wild exclamation upon the whale and essay to get a fair chance for -PRON- poised lance lo
chapter_71	next instant the luckless mate so full of furious life be smite bodily into the air and make a long arc in -PRON- descent fall into the sea at the distance of about fifty yard
chapter_71	not a chip of the boat be harm nor a hair of any oarsman 's head but the mate for ever sink
chapter_71	-PRON- be well to parenthesize here that of the fatal accident in the sperm whale fishery this kind be perhaps almost as frequent as any
chapter_71	but strange of all be the circumstance that in more instance than one when the body have be recover not a single mark of violence be discernible the man be stark dead
chapter_71	"raise a pierce shriek--""the vial"
chapter_71	the vial
chapter_71	gabriel call off the terror stricken crew from the further hunting of the whale
chapter_71	this terrible event clothe the archangel with add influence because -PRON- credulous disciple believe that -PRON- have specifically fore announce -PRON- instead of only make a general prophecy which any one may have do and so have chance to hit one of many mark in the wide margin allow
chapter_71	mayhew have conclude -PRON- narration ahab put such question to -PRON- that the stranger captain could not forbear inquire whether -PRON- intend to hunt the white whale if opportunity should offer
chapter_71	"to which ahab answered--""aye"
chapter_71	"straightway then gabriel once more start to -PRON- foot glare upon the old man and vehemently exclaim with downward point finger--""think think of the blasphemer dead and down there!--beware of the blasphemer 's end"
chapter_71	ahab stolidly turn aside then say to mayhew captain -PRON- have just bethink -PRON- of -PRON- letter bag there be a letter for one of thy officer if -PRON- mistake not
chapter_71	starbuck look over the bag
chapter_71	every whale ship take out a goodly number of letter for various ship whose delivery to the person to whom -PRON- may be address depend upon the mere chance of encounter -PRON- in the four ocean
chapter_71	-PRON- be sorely tumble damp and cover with a dull spot green mould in consequence of be keep in a dark locker of the cabin
chapter_71	of such a letter death -PRON- may well have be the post boy
chapter_71	can'st not read -PRON- cry ahab
chapter_71	a dim scrawl
chapter_71	what be this
chapter_71	as -PRON- be study -PRON- out starbuck take a long cutting spade pole and with -PRON- knife slightly split the end to insert the letter there and in that way hand -PRON- to the boat without -PRON- come any close to the ship
chapter_71	meantime ahab hold the letter mutter mr. har
chapter_71	yes mr. harry--(a woman 's pinny hand the man 's wife
chapter_71	-PRON- will wager)--aye
chapter_71	mr
chapter_71	harry macey ship jeroboam
chapter_71	why -PRON- be macey and -PRON- be dead
chapter_71	
chapter_71	poor fellow
chapter_71	poor fellow
chapter_71	and from -PRON- wife sigh mayhew but let -PRON- have -PRON-
chapter_71	
chapter_71	nay keep -PRON- thyself cry gabriel to ahab thou art soon go that way
chapter_71	
chapter_71	curse throttle thee
chapter_71	
chapter_71	but as -PRON- do so the oarsman expectantly desist from rowing the boat drift a little towards the ship 's stern so that as if by magic the letter suddenly range along with gabriel 's eager hand
chapter_72	now hand be want here and then again hand be want there
chapter_72	there be no stay in any one place for at one and the same time everything have to be do everywhere
chapter_72	-PRON- be much the same with -PRON- who endeavor the description of the scene
chapter_72	-PRON- must now retrace -PRON- way a little
chapter_72	-PRON- be mention that upon first break ground in the whale 's back the blubber hook be insert into the original hole there cut by the spade of the mate
chapter_72	but how do so clumsy and weighty a mass as that same hook get fix in that hole
chapter_72	-PRON- be insert there by -PRON- particular friend queequeg whose duty -PRON- be as harpooneer to descend upon the monster 's back for the special purpose refer to
chapter_72	the whale be -PRON- observe lie almost entirely submerge except the immediate part operate upon
chapter_72	on the occasion in question queequeg figure in the highland costume a shirt and sock in which to -PRON- eye at least -PRON- appear to uncommon advantage and no one have a good chance to observe -PRON- as will presently be see
chapter_72	just so from the ship 's steep side do
chapter_72	-PRON- be a humorously perilous business for both of -PRON-
chapter_72	so that for good or for bad -PRON- two for the time be wed and should poor queequeg sink to rise no more then both usage and honour demand that instead of cut the cord -PRON- should drag -PRON- down in -PRON- wake
chapter_72	so strongly and metaphysically do -PRON- conceive of -PRON- situation then that while earnestly watch -PRON- motion -PRON- seem distinctly to perceive that -PRON- own individuality be now merge in a joint stock company of two that -PRON- free will have receive a mortal wound and that another 's mistake or misfortune may plunge innocent -PRON- into unmerited disaster and death
chapter_72	therefore -PRON- see that here be a sort of interregnum in providence for -PRON- even handed equity never could have so gross an injustice
chapter_72	and yet still further ponder while -PRON- jerk -PRON- now and then from between the whale and ship which would threaten to jam -PRON- still further ponder -PRON- say -PRON- see that this situation of mine be the precise situation of every mortal that breathe only in most case -PRON- one way or other have this siamese connexion with a plurality of other mortal
chapter_72	true -PRON- may say that by exceed caution -PRON- may possibly escape these and the multitudinous other evil chance of life
chapter_72	but handle queequeg 's monkey rope heedfully as -PRON- would sometimes -PRON- jerk -PRON- so that -PRON- come very near slide overboard
chapter_72	
chapter_72	the monkey rope be find in all whaler but -PRON- be only in the pequod that the monkey and -PRON- holder be ever tie together
chapter_72	but this be not the only jamming jeopardy -PRON- be expose to
chapter_72	unappalled by the massacre make upon -PRON- during the night the shark now freshly and more keenly allure by the before pen blood which begin to flow from the carcass the rabid creature swarm round -PRON- like bee in a beehive
chapter_72	a thing altogether incredible be -PRON- not that attract by such prey as a dead whale the otherwise miscellaneously carnivorous shark will seldom touch a man
chapter_72	nevertheless -PRON- may well be believe that since -PRON- have such a ravenous finger in the pie -PRON- be deem but wise to look sharp to -PRON-
chapter_72	accordingly besides the monkey rope with which -PRON- now and then jerk the poor fellow from too close a vicinity to the maw of what seem a peculiarly ferocious shark -PRON- be provide with still another protection
chapter_72	-PRON- mean queequeg 's good happiness -PRON- admit but in -PRON- hasty zeal to befriend -PRON- and from the circumstance that both -PRON- and the shark be at time half hide by the blood muddle water those indiscreet spade of -PRON- would come nearer amputate a leg than a tall
chapter_72	but poor queequeg -PRON- suppose strain and gasp there with that great iron hook poor queequeg -PRON- suppose only pray to -PRON- yojo and give up -PRON- life into the hand of -PRON- god
chapter_72	well well -PRON- dear comrade and twin brother think -PRON- as -PRON- draw in and then slack off the rope to every swell of the sea what matter -PRON- after all
chapter_72	be -PRON- not the precious image of each and all of -PRON- man in this whaling world
chapter_72	that unsound ocean -PRON- gasp in be life those shark -PRON- foe those spade -PRON- friend and what between shark and spade -PRON- be in a sad pickle and peril poor lad
chapter_72	there be good cheer in store for -PRON- queequeg
chapter_72	for now as with blue lip and blood shoot eye the exhausted savage at last climb up the chain and stand all drip and involuntarily tremble over the side the steward advance and with a benevolent consolatory glance hand -PRON- what
chapter_72	some hot cognac
chapter_72	hand -PRON- a cup of tepid ginger and water
chapter_72	ginger
chapter_72	then stand as if incredulous for a while -PRON- calmly walk towards the astonished steward slowly say ginger ginger
chapter_72	and will -PRON- have the goodness to tell -PRON-
chapter_72	mr. dough boy where lie the virtue of ginger
chapter_72	firewood
chapter_72	there be some sneak temperance society movement about this business -PRON- suddenly add now approach starbuck who have just come from forward
chapter_72	will -PRON- look at that kannakin sir smell of -PRON- if -PRON- please
chapter_72	then watch the mate 's countenance -PRON- add
chapter_72	be the steward an apothecary sir
chapter_72	-PRON- trust not say starbuck -PRON- be poor stuff enough
chapter_72	
chapter_72	aye aye steward cry stubb -PRON- will teach -PRON- to drug -PRON- harpooneer none of -PRON- apothecary 's medicine here -PRON- want to poison -PRON- do ye
chapter_72	
chapter_72	
chapter_72	ginger jub
chapter_72	-PRON- gingerly rascal take that and run along with ye to the locker and get something good
chapter_72	-PRON- hope -PRON- do no wrong mr. starbuck
chapter_72	-PRON- be the captain 's order grog for the harpooneer on a whale
chapter_72	enough reply starbuck only do not hit -PRON- again
chapter_72	but-- oh -PRON- never hurt when -PRON- hit except when -PRON- hit a whale or something of that sort and this fellow be a weazel
chapter_72	what be -PRON- about say sir
chapter_72	only this go down with -PRON- and get what thou wantest thyself
chapter_72	when stubb reappear -PRON- come with a dark flask in one hand and a sort of tea caddy in the other
chapter_73	stubb and flask kill a right whale and then have a talk over him
chapter_73	-PRON- must be bear in mind that all this time -PRON- have a sperm whale 's prodigious head hang to the pequod 's side
chapter_73	but -PRON- must let -PRON- continue hang there a while till -PRON- can get a chance to attend to -PRON-
chapter_73	now during the past night and forenoon the pequod have gradually drift into a sea which by -PRON- occasional patch of yellow brit give unusual token of the vicinity of right whales a species of the leviathan that but few suppose to be at this particular time lurk anywhere near
chapter_73	nor be this long want
chapter_73	pulling further and further away -PRON- at last become almost invisible to the man at the mast head
chapter_73	but suddenly in the distance -PRON- see a great heap of tumultuous white water and soon after news come from aloft that one or both the boat must be fast
chapter_73	an interval pass and the boat be in plain sight in the act of be drag right towards the ship by the tow whale
chapter_73	so close do the monster come to the hull that at first -PRON- seem as if -PRON- mean -PRON- malice but suddenly go down in a maelstrom within three rod of the plank -PRON- wholly disappear from view as if diving under the keel
chapter_73	but have plenty of line yet in the tub and the whale not sound very rapidly -PRON- pay out abundance of rope and at the same time pull with all -PRON- might so as to get ahead of the ship
chapter_73	for a few minute the struggle be intensely critical for while -PRON- still slack out the tighten line in one direction and still ply -PRON- oar in another the contend strain threaten to take -PRON- under
chapter_73	and -PRON- stick to -PRON- till -PRON- do gain -PRON- when instantly a swift tremor be feel run like lightning along the keel as the strained line scrap beneath the ship suddenly rise to view under -PRON- bow snap and quiver and so fling off -PRON- dripping that the drop fall like bit of broken glass on the water while the whale beyond also rise to sight and once more the boat be free to fly
chapter_73	but the fag whale abate -PRON- speed and blindly alter -PRON- course go round the stern of the ship tow the two boat after -PRON- so that -PRON- perform a complete circuit
chapter_73	at last -PRON- spout grow thick and with a frightful roll and vomit -PRON- turn upon -PRON- back a corpse
chapter_73	while the two headsman be engage in make fast cord to -PRON- fluke and in other way get the mass in readiness for towing some conversation ensue between -PRON-
chapter_73	want with -PRON-
chapter_73	say flask coil some spare line in the boat 's bow do -PRON- never hear that the ship which but once have a sperm whale 's head hoist on -PRON- starboard side and at the same time a right whale be on the larboard do -PRON- never hear stubb that that ship can never afterwards capsize
chapter_73	why not -PRON- do not know but -PRON- hear that gamboge ghost of a fedallah say so and -PRON- seem to know all about ship charm
chapter_73	but -PRON- sometimes think -PRON- will charm the ship to no good at last
chapter_73	-PRON- do not half like that chap stubb
chapter_73	do -PRON- ever notice how that tusk of -PRON- be a sort of carve into a snake 's head stubb
chapter_73	sink -PRON-
chapter_73	-PRON- never look at -PRON- at all but if ever -PRON- get a chance of a dark night and -PRON- stand hard by the bulwark and no one by look down there
chapter_73	"hands--""aye will -PRON-"
chapter_73	do -PRON- believe that cock and bull story about -PRON- have be stow away on board ship
chapter_73	the reason why -PRON- do not see -PRON- tail be because -PRON- tuck -PRON- up out of sight -PRON- carry -PRON- coil away in -PRON- pocket -PRON- guess
chapter_73	now that -PRON- think of -PRON- -PRON- be always want oakum to stuff into the toe of -PRON- boot
chapter_73	
chapter_73	-PRON- sleep in -PRON- boot do not -PRON-
chapter_73	-PRON- have not get any hammock but -PRON- have see -PRON- lay of night in a coil of rigging
chapter_73	
chapter_73	what be the old man have so much to do with -PRON- for
chapter_73	strike up a swap or a bargain -PRON- suppose
chapter_73	bargain about what
chapter_73	why do ye see the old man be hard bent after that white whale and the devil there be try to come round -PRON- and get -PRON- to swap away -PRON- silver watch or -PRON- soul or something of that sort and then -PRON- will surrender moby dick
chapter_73	
chapter_73	pooh
chapter_73	stubb -PRON- be skylark how can fedallah do that
chapter_73	-PRON- do not know flask but the devil be a curious chap and a wicked one -PRON- tell ye
chapter_73	what for say the old governor
chapter_73	what business be that of -PRON- say the devil get mad,--'i want to use -PRON-
chapter_73	but look sharp
chapter_73	ain't -PRON- all ready there
chapter_73	-PRON- think -PRON- remember some such story as -PRON- be tell say flask when at last the two boat be slowly advance with -PRON- burden towards the ship but -PRON- can not remember where
chapter_73	three spaniards
chapter_73	adventure of those three bloody minded soladoe
chapter_73	do ye read -PRON- there flask
chapter_73	-PRON- guess ye do
chapter_73	no never see such a book hear of -PRON- though
chapter_73	be -PRON- the same man that help kill this whale
chapter_73	and if the devil have a latch key to get into the admiral 's cabin do not -PRON- suppose -PRON- can crawl into a porthole
chapter_73	how old do -PRON- suppose fedallah be stubb
chapter_73	nor all the cooper in creation could not show hoop enough to make ought enough
chapter_73	
chapter_73	but -PRON- would crawl back
chapter_73	duck -PRON- again and keep duck -PRON-
chapter_73	suppose -PRON- should take -PRON- into -PRON- head to duck -PRON- though yes and drown -PRON- what then
chapter_73	-PRON- should like to see -PRON- try -PRON- -PRON- would give -PRON- such a pair of black eye that -PRON- would not dare to show -PRON- face in the admiral 's cabin again for a long while let alone down in the orlop there where -PRON- live and hereabouts on the upper deck where -PRON- sneak so much
chapter_73	damn the devil flask
chapter_73	who be afraid of -PRON- except the old governor who daresn't catch -PRON- and put -PRON- in double darbie as -PRON- deserve but let -PRON- go about kidnapping people aye and sign a bond with -PRON- that all the people the devil kidnap -PRON- would roast for -PRON-
chapter_73	there be a governor
chapter_73	
chapter_73	
chapter_73	do -PRON- suppose -PRON-
chapter_73	-PRON- will know -PRON- before long flask
chapter_73	look here beelzebub -PRON- do not do -PRON- and if -PRON- make any fuss by the lord -PRON- will make a grab into -PRON- pocket for -PRON- tail take -PRON- to the capstan and give -PRON- such a wrenching and heaving that -PRON- tail will come short off at the stump do -PRON- see and then -PRON- rather guess when -PRON- find -PRON- dock in that queer fashion -PRON- will sneak off without the poor satisfaction of feel -PRON- tail between -PRON- leg
chapter_73	and what will -PRON- do with the tail stubb
chapter_73	sell -PRON- for an ox whip when -PRON- get home
chapter_73	what else
chapter_73	now do -PRON- mean what -PRON- say and have be say all along stubb
chapter_73	mean or not mean here -PRON- be at the ship
chapter_73	the boat be here hail to tow the whale on the larboard side where fluke chain and other necessary be already prepare for secure -PRON-
chapter_73	
chapter_73	in good time flask 's saying prove true
chapter_73	so when on one side -PRON- hoist in locke 's head -PRON- go over that way but now on the other side hoist in kant 's and -PRON- come back again but in very poor plight
chapter_73	thus some mind for ever keep trim boat
chapter_73	in dispose of the body of a right whale when bring alongside the ship the same preliminary proceeding commonly take place as in the case of a sperm whale only in the latter instance the head be cut off whole but in the former the lip and tongue be separately remove and hoist on deck with all the well know black bone attach to what be call the crown piece
chapter_73	but nothing like this in the present case have be do
chapter_73	meantime fedallah be calmly eye the right whale 's head and ever and anon glance from the deep wrinkle there to the line in -PRON- own hand
chapter_74	the sperm whale 's head contrast view
chapter_74	here now be two great whale lay -PRON- head together let -PRON- join -PRON- and lie together -PRON- own
chapter_74	of the grand order of folio leviathan the sperm whale and the right whale be by far the most noteworthy
chapter_74	-PRON- be the only whale regularly hunt by man
chapter_74	to the nantucketer -PRON- present the two extreme of all the know variety of the whale
chapter_74	in the first place -PRON- be strike by the general contrast between these head
chapter_74	both be massive enough in all conscience but there be a certain mathematical symmetry in the sperm whale 's which the right whale 's sadly lack
chapter_74	there be more character in the sperm whale 's head
chapter_74	in the present instance too this dignity be heighten by the pepper and salt colour of -PRON- head at the summit give token of advanced age and large experience
chapter_74	in short -PRON- be what the fisherman technically call a grey head whale
chapter_74	let -PRON- now note what be least dissimilar in these head namely the two most important organ the eye and the ear
chapter_74	far back on the side of the head and low down near the angle of either whale 's jaw if -PRON- narrowly search -PRON- will at last see a lashless eye which -PRON- would fancy to be a young colt 's eye
chapter_74	so out of all proportion be -PRON- to the magnitude of the head
chapter_74	now from this peculiar sideway position of the whale 's eye -PRON- be plain that -PRON- can never see an object which be exactly ahead no more than -PRON- can one exactly astern
chapter_74	in a word the position of the whale 's eye correspond to that of a man 's ear and -PRON- may fancy for -PRON- how -PRON- would fare with -PRON- do -PRON- sideways survey object through -PRON- ear
chapter_74	-PRON- would find that -PRON- could only command some thirty degree of vision in advance of the straight side line of sight and about thirty more behind -PRON-
chapter_74	in a word -PRON- would have two back so to speak but at the same time also two front side front for what be -PRON- that make the front of a man what indeed but -PRON- eye
chapter_74	moreover while in most other animal that -PRON- can now think of the eye be so plant as imperceptibly to blend -PRON- visual power so as to produce one picture and not two to the brain the peculiar position of the whale 's eye effectually divide as -PRON- be by many cubic foot of solid head which tower between -PRON- like a great mountain separate two lake in valley this of course must wholly separate the impression which each independent organ impart
chapter_74	the whale therefore must see one distinct picture on this side and another distinct picture on that side while all between must be profound darkness and nothingness to -PRON-
chapter_74	man may in effect be say to look out on the world from a sentry box with two joined sash for -PRON- window
chapter_74	this peculiarity of the whale 's eye be a thing always to be bear in mind in the fishery and to be remember by the reader in some subsequent scene
chapter_74	nevertheless any one 's experience will teach -PRON- that though -PRON- can take in an undiscriminating sweep of thing at one glance -PRON- be quite impossible for -PRON- attentively and completely to examine any two thing however large or however small at one and the same
chapter_74	but if -PRON- now come to separate these two object and surround each by a circle of profound darkness then in order to see one of -PRON- in such a manner as to bring -PRON- mind to bear on -PRON- the other will be utterly exclude from -PRON- contemporary consciousness
chapter_74	true both -PRON- eye in -PRON- must simultaneously act but be -PRON- brain so much more comprehensive combining and subtle than man 's that -PRON- can at the same moment of time attentively examine two distinct prospect one on one side of -PRON- and the other in an exactly opposite direction
chapter_74	-PRON- may be but an idle whim but -PRON- have always seem to -PRON- that the extraordinary vacillation of movement display by some whale when beset by three or four boat the timidity and liability to queer fright so common to such whale -PRON- think that all this indirectly proceed from the helpless perplexity of volition in which -PRON- divide and diametrically opposite power of vision must involve -PRON-
chapter_74	if -PRON- be an entire stranger to -PRON- race -PRON- may hunt over these two head for hour and never discover that organ
chapter_74	the ear have no external leaf whatev and into the hole -PRON- -PRON- can hardly insert a quill so wondrously minute be -PRON-
chapter_74	-PRON- be lodge a little behind the eye
chapter_74	while the ear of the former have an external opening that of the latter be entirely and evenly cover over with a membrane so as to be quite imperceptible from without
chapter_74	not at all
chapter_74	why then do -PRON- try to enlarge -PRON- mind
chapter_74	but let -PRON- hold on here by this tooth and look about -PRON- where -PRON- be
chapter_74	but come out now and look at this portentous low jaw which seem like the long narrow lid of an immense snuff box with the hinge at one end instead of one side
chapter_74	if -PRON- pry -PRON- up so as to get -PRON- overhead and expose -PRON- row of tooth -PRON- seem a terrific portcullis and such alas
chapter_74	-PRON- prove to many a poor wight in the fishery upon whom these spike fall with impale force
chapter_74	this whale be not dead -PRON- be only dispirited out of sort perhaps hypochondriac and so supine that the hinge of -PRON- jaw have relaxed leave -PRON- there in that ungainly sort of plight a reproach to all -PRON- tribe who must no doubt imprecate lock jaw upon -PRON-
chapter_74	with a long weary hoist the jaw be drag on board as if -PRON- be an anchor and when the proper time come some few day after the other work queequeg daggoo and tashtego be all accomplished dentist be set to draw tooth
chapter_74	with a keen cutting spade queequeg lance the gum then the jaw be lash down to ringbolt and a tackle be rig from aloft -PRON- drag out these tooth as michigan oxen drag stump of old oak out of wild wood land
chapter_74	there be generally forty two tooth in all in old whale much wear down but undecayed nor fill after -PRON- artificial fashion
chapter_74	the jaw be afterwards saw into slab and pile away like joist for build house
chapter_75	crossing the deck let -PRON- now have a good long look at the right whale 's head
chapter_75	as in general shape the noble sperm whale 's head may be compare to a roman war chariot especially in front where -PRON- be so broadly rounded so at a broad view the right whale 's head bear a rather inelegant resemblance to a gigantic galliot toed shoe
chapter_75	two hundred year ago an old dutch voyager liken -PRON- shape to that of a shoemaker 's last
chapter_75	but as -PRON- come nearer to this great head -PRON- begin to assume different aspect accord to -PRON- point of view
chapter_75	if -PRON- stand on -PRON- summit and look at these two f shape spouthole -PRON- would take the whole head for an enormous bass viol and these spiracle the aperture in -PRON- sounding board
chapter_75	then again if -PRON- fix -PRON- eye upon this strange crested comb like incrustation on the top of the mass this green barnacled thing which the greenlanders call the crown and the southern fisher the bonnet of the right whale fix -PRON- eye solely on this -PRON- would take the head for the trunk of some huge oak with a bird 's nest in -PRON- crotch
chapter_75	at any rate when -PRON- watch those live crab that nestle here on this bonnet such an idea will be almost sure to occur to -PRON- unless indeed -PRON- fancy have be fix by the technical term crown also bestow upon -PRON- in which case -PRON- will take great interest in thinking how this mighty monster be actually a diadem king of the sea whose green crown have be put together for -PRON- in this marvellous manner
chapter_75	but if this whale be a king -PRON- be a very sulky look fellow to grace a diadem
chapter_75	look at that hang low lip
chapter_75	a sulk and pout by carpenter 's measurement about twenty foot long and five foot deep a sulk and pout that will yield -PRON- some 500 gallon of oil and more
chapter_75	a great pity now that this unfortunate whale should be hare lipped
chapter_75	the fissure be about a foot across
chapter_75	probably the mother during an important interval be sail down the peruvian coast when earthquake cause the beach to gape
chapter_75	upon -PRON- word be -PRON- at mackinaw -PRON- should take this to be the inside of an indian wigwam
chapter_75	good lord be this the road that jonah go
chapter_75	the roof be about twelve foot high and run to a pretty sharp angle as if there be a regular ridge pole there while these rib arched hairy side present -PRON- with those wondrous half vertical scimetar shape slat of whalebone say three hundred on a side which depend from the upper part of the head or crown bone form those venetian blind which have elsewhere be cursorily mention
chapter_75	the edge of these bone be fringe with hairy fibre through which the right whale strain the water and in whose intricacy -PRON- retain the small fish when openmouth -PRON- go through the sea of brit in feed time
chapter_75	though the certainty of this criterion be far from demonstrable yet -PRON- have the savor of analogical probability
chapter_75	at any rate if -PRON- yield to -PRON- -PRON- must grant a far great age to the right whale than at first glance will seem reasonable
chapter_75	one voyager in purchas call -PRON- the wondrous whisker inside of the whale 's mouth another hog bristle a third old gentleman in hackluyt use the following elegant language there be about two hundred and fifty fin grow on each side of -PRON- upper chop which arch over -PRON- tongue on each side of -PRON- mouth
chapter_75	
chapter_75	
chapter_75	this remind -PRON- that the right whale really have a sort of whisker or rather a moustache consist of a few scatter white hair on the upper part of the outer end of the low jaw
chapter_75	but in this particular the demand have long be on the decline
chapter_75	-PRON- be in queen anne 's time that the bone be in -PRON- glory the farthingale be then all the fashion
chapter_75	and as those ancient dame move about gaily though in the jaw of the whale as -PRON- may say even so in a shower with the like thoughtlessness do -PRON- nowadays fly under the same jaw for protection the umbrella be a tent spread over the same bone
chapter_75	but now forget all about blind and whisker for a moment and standing in the right whale 's mouth look around -PRON- afresh
chapter_75	see all these colonnade of bone so methodically range about would -PRON- not think -PRON- be inside of the great haarlem organ and gaze upon -PRON- thousand pipe
chapter_75	-PRON- be very fat and tender and apt to tear in piece in hoist -PRON- on deck
chapter_75	this particular tongue now before -PRON- at a passing glance -PRON- should say -PRON- be a six barreler that is -PRON- will yield -PRON- about that amount of oil
chapter_75	ere this -PRON- must have plainly see the truth of what -PRON- start with that the sperm whale and the right whale have almost entirely different head
chapter_75	to sum up then in the right whale 's there be no great well of sperm no ivory tooth at all no long slender mandible of a low jaw like the sperm whale 's
chapter_75	again the right whale have two external spout hole the sperm whale only one
chapter_75	can -PRON- catch the expression of the sperm whale 's there
chapter_75	-PRON- be the same -PRON- die with only some of the long wrinkle in the forehead seem now fade away
chapter_75	-PRON- think -PRON- broad brow to be full of a prairie like placidity bear of a speculative indifference as to death
chapter_75	but mark the other head 's expression
chapter_75	this right whale -PRON- take to have be a stoic the sperm whale a platonian who may have take up spinoza in -PRON- latter year
chapter_76	the battering ram ere quit for the nonce the sperm whale 's head -PRON- would have -PRON- as a sensible physiologist simply particularly remark -PRON- front aspect in all -PRON- compacted collectedness
chapter_76	-PRON- would have -PRON- investigate -PRON- now with the sole view of form to -PRON- some unexaggerated intelligent estimate of whatev battering ram power may be lodge there
chapter_76	-PRON- observe that in the ordinary swimming position of the sperm whale the front of -PRON- head present an almost wholly vertical plane to the water -PRON- observe that the low part of that front slope considerably backwards so as to furnish more of a retreat for the long socket which receive the boom like low jaw -PRON- observe that the mouth be entirely under the head much in the same way indeed as though -PRON- own mouth be entirely under -PRON- chin
chapter_76	do -PRON- come to the full cranial development
chapter_76	so that this whole enormous boneless mass be as one wad
chapter_76	finally though as will soon be reveal -PRON- content partly comprise the most delicate oil yet -PRON- be now to be apprise of the nature of the substance which so impregnably invest all that apparent effeminacy
chapter_76	just so with the head but with this difference about the head this envelope though not so thick be of a boneless toughness inestimable by any man who have not handle -PRON-
chapter_76	the severe pointed harpoon the sharp lance dart by the strong human arm impotently rebound from -PRON-
chapter_76	-PRON- be as though the forehead of the sperm whale be pave with horse hoof
chapter_76	-PRON- do not think that any sensation lurk in -PRON-
chapter_76	when two large loaded indiamen chance to crowd and crush towards each other in the dock what do the sailor do
chapter_76	-PRON- do not suspend between -PRON- at the point of come contact any merely hard substance like iron or wood
chapter_76	that bravely and uninjured take the jam which would have snap all -PRON- oaken handspike and iron crow bar
chapter_76	by -PRON- this sufficiently illustrate the obvious fact -PRON- drive at
chapter_76	but supplementary to this -PRON- have hypothetically occur to -PRON- that as ordinary fish possess what be call a swimming bladder in -PRON- capable at will of distension or contraction and as the sperm whale as far as -PRON- know have no such provision in -PRON- consider too the otherwise inexplicable manner in which -PRON- now depress -PRON- head altogether beneath the surface and anon swim with -PRON- high elevate out of the water consider the unobstructed elasticity of -PRON- envelope consider the unique interior of -PRON- head -PRON- have hypothetically occur to -PRON- -PRON- say that those mystical lung cell honeycomb there may possibly have some hitherto unknown and unsuspected connexion with the outer air so as to be susceptible to atmospheric distension and contraction
chapter_76	so that when -PRON- shall hereafter detail to -PRON- all the speciality and concentration of potency everywhere lurk in this expansive monster when -PRON- shall show -PRON- some of -PRON- more inconsiderable brain feat -PRON- trust -PRON- will have renounce all ignorant incredulity and be ready to abide by this that though the sperm whale stove a passage through the isthmus of darien and mixed the atlantic with the pacific -PRON- would not elevate one hair of -PRON- eye brow
chapter_76	for unless -PRON- own the whale -PRON- be but a provincial and sentimentalist in truth
chapter_76	but clear truth be a thing for salamander giant only to encounter how small the chance for the provincial then
chapter_76	what befall the weakling youth lift the dread goddess 's veil at lais
chapter_77	the great heidelburgh tun
chapter_77	now come the baling of the case
chapter_77	regard the sperm whale 's head as a solid oblong -PRON- may on an inclined plane sideways divide -PRON- into two quoin whereof the lower be the bony structure form the cranium and jaw and the upper an unctuous mass wholly free from bone -PRON- broad forward end form the expand vertical apparent forehead of the whale
chapter_77	at the middle of the forehead horizontally subdivide this upper quoin and then -PRON- have two almost equal part which before be naturally divide by an internal wall of a thick tendinous substance
chapter_77	quoin be not a euclidean term
chapter_77	-PRON- belong to the pure nautical mathematic
chapter_77	a quoin be a solid which differ from a wedge in have -PRON- sharp end form by the steep inclination of one side instead of the mutual tapering of both side
chapter_77	the low subdivide part call the junk be one immense honeycomb of oil form by the crossing and recross into ten thousand infiltrate cell of tough elastic white fibre throughout -PRON- whole extent
chapter_77	nor be this precious substance find unalloyed in any other part of the creature
chapter_77	though in life -PRON- remain perfectly fluid yet upon exposure to the air after death -PRON- soon begin to concrete send forth beautiful crystalline shoot as when the first thin delicate ice be just form in water
chapter_77	a large whale 's case generally yield about five hundred gallon of sperm though from unavoidable circumstance considerable of -PRON- be spill leak and dribble away or be otherwise irrevocably lose in the ticklish business of secure what -PRON- can
chapter_77	as in decapitate the whale the operator 's instrument be bring close to the spot where an entrance be subsequently force into the spermaceti magazine -PRON- have therefore to be uncommonly heedful lest a careless untimely stroke should invade the sanctuary and wastingly let out -PRON- invaluable content
chapter_77	-PRON- be this decapitated end of the head also which be at last elevate out of the water and retain in that position by the enormous cutting tackle whose hempen combination on one side make quite a wilderness of rope in that quarter
chapter_77	thus much being say attend now -PRON- pray -PRON- to that marvellous and in this particular instance almost fatal operation whereby the sperm whale 's great heidelburgh tun be tap
chapter_78	cistern and buckets nimble as a cat tashtego mount aloft and without alter -PRON- erect posture run straight out upon the overhang mainyard arm to the part where -PRON- exactly project over the hoist tun
chapter_78	-PRON- have carry with -PRON- a light tackle call a whip consist of only two part travel through a single sheav block
chapter_78	secure this block so that -PRON- hang down from the yard arm -PRON- swing one end of the rope till -PRON- be catch and firmly hold by a hand on deck
chapter_78	in this business -PRON- proceed very heedfully like a treasure hunter in some old house sound the wall to find where the gold be mason in
chapter_78	insert this pole into the bucket tashtego downward guide the bucket into the tun till -PRON- entirely disappear then give the word to the seaman at the whip up come the bucket again all bubble like a dairy maid 's pail of new milk
chapter_78	carefully lower from -PRON- height the full freight vessel be catch by an appoint hand and quickly empty into a large tub
chapter_78	then remount aloft -PRON- again go through the same round until the deep cistern will yield no more
chapter_78	towards the end tashtego have to ram -PRON- long pole harder and harder and deep and deep into the tun until some twenty foot of the pole have go down
chapter_78	whether -PRON- be that tashtego that wild indian be so heedless and reckless as to let go for a moment -PRON- one handed hold on the great cabled tackle suspend the head or whether the place where -PRON- stand be so treacherous and oozy or whether the evil one -PRON- would have -PRON- to fall out so without state -PRON- particular reason how -PRON- be exactly there be no tell now but on a sudden as the eightieth or ninetieth bucket come suckingly up -PRON- god
chapter_78	poor tashtego like the twin reciprocate bucket in a veritable well drop head foremost down into this great tun of heidelburgh and with a horrible oily gurgling go clean out of sight man overboard
chapter_78	cry daggoo who amid the general consternation
chapter_78	first come to -PRON- sens
chapter_78	sw the bucket this way and put one foot into -PRON- so as the good to secure -PRON- slippery hand hold on the whip -PRON- the hoister run -PRON- high up to the top of the head almost before tashtego could have reach -PRON- interior bottom
chapter_78	meantime there be a terrible tumult
chapter_78	look over the side -PRON- see the before lifeless head throb and heave just below the surface of the sea as if that moment seize with some momentous idea whereas -PRON- be only the poor indian unconsciously reveal by those struggle the perilous depth to which -PRON- have sink
chapter_78	at this instant while daggoo on the summit of the head be clear the whip which have somehow get foul of the great cutting tackle a sharp cracking noise be hear and to the unspeakable horror of all one of the two enormous hook suspend the head tear out and with a vast vibration the enormous mass sideways swing till the drunk ship reel and shake as if smite by an iceberg
chapter_78	yell the seaman to daggoo but with one hand holding on to the heavy tackle so that if the head should drop -PRON- would still remain suspend the negro have clear the foul line ram down the bucket into the now collapse well meaning that the bury harpooneer should grasp -PRON- and so be hoist out
chapter_78	how will that help -PRON- jam that iron bind bucket on top of -PRON- head
chapter_78	avast will ye
chapter_78	stand clear of the tackle cry a voice like the bursting of a rocket
chapter_78	but hardly have the blind vapour clear away when a naked figure with a boarding sword in -PRON- hand be for one swift moment see hover over the bulwark
chapter_78	one packed rush be make to the side and every eye count every ripple as moment follow moment and no sign of either the sinker or the diver could be see
chapter_78	ha ha
chapter_78	"both!--it be both!""--cried daggoo again with a joyful shout and soon after queequeg be see boldly strike out with one hand and with the other clutch the long hair of the indian"
chapter_78	draw into the wait boat -PRON- be quickly bring to the deck but tashtego be long in come to and queequeg do not look very brisk
chapter_78	now how have this noble rescue be accomplish
chapter_78	why dive after the slowly descend head queequeg with -PRON- keen sword have make side lunge near -PRON- bottom so as to scuttle a large hole there then drop -PRON- sword have thrust -PRON- long arm far inwards and upwards and so haul out poor tash by the head
chapter_78	-PRON- aver that upon first thrust in for -PRON- a leg be present but well know that that be not as -PRON- ought to be and may occasion great trouble -PRON- have thrust back the leg and by a dexterous heave and toss have work a somerset upon the indian so that with the next trial -PRON- come forth in the good old way head foremost
chapter_78	and thus through the courage and great skill in obstetric of queequeg the deliverance or rather delivery of tashtego be successfully accomplish in the tooth too of the most untoward and apparently hopeless impediment which be a lesson by no mean to be forget
chapter_78	midwifery should be teach in the same course with fencing and boxing rid and rowing
chapter_78	-PRON- know that this queer adventure of the gay header 's will be sure to seem incredible to some landsman though -PRON- -PRON- may have either see or hear of some one 's fall into a cistern ashore an accident which not seldom happen and with much less reason too than the indian 's consider the exceed slipperiness of the curb of the sperm whale 's well
chapter_78	but peradventure -PRON- may be sagaciously urge how be this
chapter_78	not at all but -PRON- have ye for at the time poor tash fall in the case have be nearly empty of -PRON- light content leave little but the dense tendinous wall of the well a double weld hammer substance as -PRON- have before say much heavy than the sea water and a lump of which sink in -PRON- like lead almost
chapter_78	now have tashtego perish in that head -PRON- have be a very precious perish smother in the very white and dainty of fragrant spermaceti coffin hears and tomb in the secret inner chamber and sanctum sanctorum of the whale
chapter_78	only one sweet end can readily be recall the delicious death of an ohio honey hunter who seek honey in the crotch of a hollow tree find such exceed store of -PRON- that lean too far over -PRON- suck -PRON- in so that -PRON- die embalmed
chapter_78	how many think ye have likewise fall into plato 's honey head and sweetly perish there
chapter_79	to scan the line of -PRON- face or feel the bump on the head of this leviathan this be a thing which no physiognomist or phrenologist have as yet undertake
chapter_79	such an enterprise would seem almost as hopeful as for lavater to have scrutinize the wrinkle on the rock of gibraltar or for gall to have mount a ladder and manipulate the dome of the pantheon
chapter_79	still in that famous work of -PRON- lavater not only treat of the various face of man but also attentively study the face of horse bird serpent and fish and dwell in detail upon the modification of expression discernible therein
chapter_79	nor have gall and -PRON- disciple spurzheim fail to throw out some hint touch the phrenological characteristic of other being than man
chapter_79	therefore though -PRON- be but ill qualified for a pioneer in the application of these two semi science to the whale -PRON- will do -PRON- endeavor
chapter_79	-PRON- try all thing -PRON- achieve what -PRON- can
chapter_79	physiognomically regard the sperm whale be an anomalous creature
chapter_79	-PRON- have no proper nose
chapter_79	and since the nose be the central and most conspicuous of the feature and since -PRON- perhaps most modify and finally control -PRON- combine expression hence -PRON- would seem that -PRON- entire absence as an external appendage must very largely affect the countenance of the whale
chapter_79	dash the nose from phidias 's marble jove and what a sorry remainder
chapter_79	nevertheless leviathan be of so mighty a magnitude all -PRON- proportion be so stately that the same deficiency which in the sculpture jove be hideous in -PRON- be no blemish at all
chapter_79	nay -PRON- be an add grandeur
chapter_79	this aspect be sublime
chapter_79	in think a fine human brow be like the east when trouble with the morning
chapter_79	in the repose of the pasture the curl brow of the bull have a touch of the grand in -PRON-
chapter_79	push heavy cannon up mountain defile the elephant 's brow be majestic
chapter_79	but in most creature nay in man -PRON- very often the brow be but a mere strip of alpine land lie along the snow line
chapter_79	for -PRON- see no one point precisely not one distinct feature be reveal no nose eye ear or mouth no face -PRON- have none proper nothing but that one broad firmament of a forehead pleat with riddle dumbly lower with the doom of boat and ship and man
chapter_79	nor in profile do this wondrous brow diminish though that way view -PRON- grandeur do not domineer upon -PRON- so
chapter_79	but how
chapter_79	genius in the sperm whale
chapter_79	no -PRON- great genius be declare in -PRON- do nothing particular to prove -PRON-
chapter_79	-PRON- deify the crocodile of the nile because the crocodile be tongueless and the sperm whale have no tongue or at least -PRON- be so exceedingly small as to be incapable of protrusion
chapter_79	but there be no champollion to decipher the egypt of every man 's and every be 's face
chapter_79	physiognomy like every other human science be but a pass fable
chapter_79	if then sir william jones who read in thirty language could not read the simple peasant 's face in -PRON- profounder and more subtle meaning how may unlettered ishmael hope to read the awful chaldee of the sperm whale 's brow
chapter_79	read -PRON- if -PRON- can
chapter_80	the nut
chapter_80	if the sperm whale be physiognomically a sphinx to the phrenologist -PRON- brain seem that geometrical circle which -PRON- be impossible to square
chapter_80	unhinge the low jaw and the side view of this skull be as the side of a moderately inclined plane rest throughout on a level base
chapter_80	at the high end the skull form a crater to bed that part of the mass while under the long floor of this crater in another cavity seldom exceed ten inch in length and as many in depth repose the mere handful of this monster 's brain
chapter_80	the brain be at least twenty foot from -PRON- apparent forehead in life -PRON- be hide away behind -PRON- vast outwork like the innermost citadel within the amplified fortification of quebec
chapter_80	lie in strange fold course and convolution to -PRON- apprehension -PRON- seem more in keep with the idea of -PRON- general might to regard that mystic part of -PRON- as the seat of -PRON- intelligence
chapter_80	-PRON- be plain then that phrenologically the head of this leviathan in the creature 's live intact state be an entire delusion
chapter_80	as for -PRON- true brain -PRON- can then see no indication of -PRON- nor feel any
chapter_80	the whale like all thing that be mighty wear a false brow to the common world
chapter_80	if -PRON- unload -PRON- skull of -PRON- spermy heap and then take a rear view of -PRON- rear end which be the high end -PRON- will be strike by -PRON- resemblance to the human skull behold in the same situation and from the same point of view
chapter_80	indeed place this reverse skull scale down to the human magnitude among a plate of man 's skull and -PRON- would involuntarily confound -PRON- with -PRON- and remark the depression on one part of -PRON- summit in phrenological phrase -PRON- would say
chapter_80	this man have no self esteem and no veneration
chapter_80	and by those negation consider along with the affirmative fact of -PRON- prodigious bulk and power -PRON- can best form to -PRON- the true though not the most exhilarating conception of what the most exalted potency be
chapter_80	if -PRON- attentively regard almost any quadruped 's spine -PRON- will be strike with the resemblance of -PRON- vertebrae to a string necklace of dwarf skull all bear rudimental resemblance to the skull proper
chapter_80	-PRON- be a german conceit that the vertebrae be absolutely undeveloped skull
chapter_80	a foreign friend once point -PRON- out to -PRON- in the skeleton of a foe -PRON- have slay and with the vertebrae of which -PRON- be inlay in a sort of basso relievo the beaked prow of -PRON- canoe
chapter_80	now -PRON- consider that the phrenologist have omit an important thing in not push -PRON- investigation from the cerebellum through the spinal canal
chapter_80	for -PRON- believe that much of a man 's character will be find betoken in -PRON- backbone
chapter_80	-PRON- would rather feel -PRON- spine than -PRON- skull whoever -PRON- be
chapter_80	a thin joist of a spine never yet uphold a full and noble soul
chapter_80	-PRON- rejoice in -PRON- spine as in the firm audacious staff of that flag which -PRON- fl half out to the world
chapter_80	-PRON- cranial cavity be continuous with the first neck vertebra and in that vertebra the bottom of the spinal canal will measure ten inch across be eight in height and of a triangular figure with the base downwards
chapter_80	as -PRON- pass through the remain vertebrae the canal taper in size but for a considerable distance remain of large capacity
chapter_80	now of course this canal be fill with much the same strangely fibrous substance the spinal cord as the brain and directly communicate with the brain
chapter_80	and what be still more for many foot after emerge from the brain 's cavity the spinal cord remain of an undecreas girth almost equal to that of the brain
chapter_80	under all these circumstance would -PRON- be unreasonable to survey and map out the whale 's spine phrenologically
chapter_80	for view in this light the wonderful comparative smallness of -PRON- brain proper be more than compensate by the wonderful comparative magnitude of -PRON- spinal cord
chapter_80	this august hump if -PRON- mistake not rise over one of the large vertebrae and be therefore in some sort the outer convex mould of -PRON-
chapter_80	and that the great monster be indomitable -PRON- will yet have reason to know
chapter_81	at one time the great whaling people in the world the dutch and germans be now among the least but here and there at very wide interval of latitude and longitude -PRON- still occasionally meet with -PRON- flag in the pacific
chapter_81	for some reason the jungfrau seem quite eager to pay -PRON- respect
chapter_81	while yet some distance from the pequod -PRON- round to and drop a boat -PRON- captain be impel towards -PRON- impatiently standing in the bow instead of the stern
chapter_81	impossible!--a lamp feeder
chapter_81	that be -PRON- boiling water
chapter_81	oh
chapter_81	go along with -PRON- cry flask -PRON- be a lamp feeder and an oil can
chapter_81	however curious -PRON- may seem for an oil ship to be borrow oil on the whale ground and however much -PRON- may invertedly contradict the old proverb about carry coal to newcastle yet sometimes such a thing really happen and in the present case captain derick de deer do indubitably conduct a lamp feeder as flask do declare
chapter_81	-PRON- necessity supply derick depart but -PRON- have not gain -PRON- ship 's side when whale be almost simultaneously raise from the mast head of both vessel and so eager for the chase be derick that without pause to put -PRON- oil can and lamp feeder aboard -PRON- slew round -PRON- boat and make after the leviathan lamp feeder
chapter_81	there be eight whale an average pod
chapter_81	whether this whale belong to the pod in advance seem questionable for -PRON- be not customary for such venerable leviathan to be at all social
chapter_81	nevertheless -PRON- stick to -PRON- wake though indeed -PRON- back water must have retard -PRON- because the white bone or swell at -PRON- broad muzzle be a dash one like the swell form when two hostile current meet
chapter_81	say stubb -PRON- have the stomach ache -PRON- be afraid
chapter_81	lord think of have half an acre of stomach ache
chapter_81	-PRON- be the first foul wind -PRON- ever know to blow from astern but look do ever whale yaw so before
chapter_81	-PRON- must be -PRON- be lose -PRON- tiller
chapter_81	as an overladen indiaman bear down the hindostan coast with a deck load of frightened horse careen bury roll and wallow on -PRON- way so do this old whale heave -PRON- aged bulk and now and then partly turn over on -PRON- cumbrous rib end expose the because of -PRON- devious wake in the unnatural stump of -PRON- starboard fin
chapter_81	whether -PRON- have lose that fin in battle or have be bear without -PRON- -PRON- be hard to say
chapter_81	
chapter_81	with one intent all the combine rival boat be point for this one fish because not only be -PRON- the large and therefore the most valuable whale but -PRON- be near to -PRON- and the other whale be go with such great velocity moreover as almost to defy pursuit for the time
chapter_81	at this juncture the pequod 's keel have shoot by the three german boat last lower but from the great start -PRON- have have derick 's boat still lead the chase though every moment near by -PRON- foreign rival
chapter_81	the only thing -PRON- fear be that from be already so nigh to -PRON- mark -PRON- would be enable to dart -PRON- iron before -PRON- could completely overtake and pass -PRON-
chapter_81	"the ungracious and ungrateful dog cry starbuck -PRON- mock and dare -PRON- with the very poor box -PRON- fill for -PRON- not five minute ago!""--then in -PRON- old intense whisper--""give way greyhound"
chapter_81	dog to -PRON-
chapter_81	"-PRON- tell ye what -PRON- be man cry stubb to -PRON- crew--""it be against -PRON- religion to get mad but -PRON- would like to eat that villainous yarman pull won't ye"
chapter_81	be ye go to let that rascal beat ye
chapter_81	do ye love brandy
chapter_81	a hogshead of brandy then to the good man
chapter_81	come why do not some of ye burst a blood vessel
chapter_81	halloo here be grass grow in the boat 's bottom and by the lord the mast there be bud
chapter_81	this will not do boy
chapter_81	look at that yarman
chapter_81	oh see the sud -PRON- make
chapter_81	"cry flask dance up and down--""what a hump"
chapter_81	oh
chapter_81	-PRON- lad do spring slap jack and quahog for supper -PRON- know -PRON- lad baked clam and muffin
chapter_81	oh do do spring
chapter_81	-PRON- be a hundred barreller don't lose -PRON- now don't oh
chapter_81	don't!--see that yarman oh will not ye pull for -PRON- duff -PRON- lad such a sog such a sogger
chapter_81	do not ye love sperm
chapter_81	there go three thousand dollar men!--a bank!--a whole bank
chapter_81	the bank of england!--oh do do
chapter_81	do!--what 's that yarman about now
chapter_81	at this moment derick be in the act of pitch -PRON- lamp feeder at the advance boat and also -PRON- oil can perhaps with the double view of retard -PRON- rival way and at the same time economically accelerate -PRON- own by the momentary impetus of the backward toss
chapter_81	pull now man like fifty thousand line of battle ship load of red haired devil
chapter_81	-PRON- say pull like god dam cry the indian fiercely but evenly incite by the taunt of the german the pequod 's three boat now begin range almost abreast and so dispose momentarily near -PRON-
chapter_81	in that fine loose chivalrous attitude of the headsman when draw near to -PRON- prey the three mate stand up proudly occasionally back the after oarsman with an exhilarating cry of there -PRON- slide now
chapter_81	down with the yarman
chapter_81	sail over -PRON-
chapter_81	but so decide an original start have derick have that spite of all -PRON- gallantry -PRON- would have prove the victor in this race have not a righteous judgment descend upon -PRON- in a crab which catch the blade of -PRON- midship oarsman
chapter_81	with a shout -PRON- take a mortal start forwards and slantingly range up on the german 's quarter
chapter_81	an instant more and all four boat be diagonically in the whale 's immediate wake while stretch from -PRON- on both side be the foam swell that -PRON- make
chapter_81	-PRON- be a terrific most pitiable and maddening sight
chapter_81	the whale be now go head out and send -PRON- spout before -PRON- in a continual tormented jet while -PRON- one poor fin beat -PRON- side in an agony of fright
chapter_81	see now that
chapter_81	but a very few moment more would give the pequod 's boat the advantage and rather than be thus foil of -PRON- game derick choose to hazard what to -PRON- must have seem a most unusually long dart ere the last chance would for ever escape
chapter_81	but no sooner do -PRON- harpooneer stand up for the stroke than all three tiger queequeg tashtego daggoo instinctively spring to -PRON- foot and stand in a diagonal row simultaneously point -PRON- barb and dart over the head of the german harpooneer -PRON- three nantucket iron enter the whale
chapter_81	blinding vapour of foam and white fire
chapter_81	the three boat in the first fury of the whale 's headlong rush bump the german 's aside with such force that both derick and -PRON- baffle harpooneer be spill out and sail over by the three flying keel
chapter_81	bernard 's dog -PRON- know relieve distressed traveller
chapter_81	hurrah
chapter_81	this be the way to sail now
chapter_81	every keel a sunbeam
chapter_81	hurrah!--here -PRON- go like three tin kettle at the tail of a mad cougar
chapter_81	this put -PRON- in mind of fasten to an elephant in a tilbury on a plain make the wheel spoke fly boy when -PRON- fasten to -PRON- that way and there be danger of be pitch out too when -PRON- strike a hill
chapter_81	hurrah
chapter_81	hurrah
chapter_81	this whale carry the everlasting mail
chapter_81	
chapter_81	but the monster 's run be a brief one
chapter_81	give a sudden gasp -PRON- tumultuously sound
chapter_81	with a grate rush the three line fly round the loggerhead with such a force as to gouge deep groove in -PRON- while so fearful be the harpooneer that this rapid sounding would soon exhaust the line that use all -PRON- dexterous might -PRON- catch repeat smoking turn with the rope to hold on till at last owe to the perpendicular strain from the lead line chock of the boat whence the three rope go straight down into the blue the gunwale of the bow be almost even with the water while the three stern tilt high in the air
chapter_81	and the whale soon cease to sound for some time -PRON- remain in that attitude fearful of expend more line though the position be a little ticklish
chapter_81	but though boat have be take down and lose in this way yet -PRON- be this hold on as -PRON- be call this hook up by the sharp barb of -PRON- live flesh from the back this -PRON- be that often torment the leviathan into soon rise again to meet the sharp lance of -PRON- foe
chapter_81	yet not to speak of the peril of the thing -PRON- be to be
chapter_81	doubt whether this course be always the good for -PRON- be but reasonable to presume that the longer the stricken whale stay under water the more -PRON- be exhausted
chapter_81	-PRON- must at least equal the weight of fifty atmosphere
chapter_81	one whaleman have estimate -PRON- at the weight of twenty line of battle ship with all -PRON- gun and store and man on board
chapter_81	as the three boat lie there on that gently roll sea gaze down into -PRON- eternal blue noon and as not a single groan or cry of any sort nay not so much as a ripple or a bubble come up from -PRON- depth what landsman would have think that beneath all that silence and placidity the utmost monster of the sea be writhe and wrench in agony
chapter_81	not eight inch of perpendicular rope be visible at the bow
chapter_81	seem -PRON- credible that by three such thin thread the great leviathan be suspend like the big weight to an eight day clock
chapter_81	the sword of -PRON- that layeth at -PRON- can not hold the spear the dart nor the habergeon
chapter_81	this -PRON-
chapter_81	oh that unfulfilment should follow the prophet
chapter_81	for with the strength of a thousand thigh in -PRON- tail leviathan have run -PRON- head under the mountain of the sea to hide -PRON- from the pequod 's fish spear
chapter_81	in that slop afternoon sunlight the shadow that the three boat send down beneath the surface must have be long enough and broad enough to shade half xerxes army
chapter_81	who can tell how appalling to the wound whale must have be such huge phantom flit over -PRON- head
chapter_81	stand by man -PRON- stir cry starbuck as the three line suddenly vibrate in the water distinctly conduct upwards to -PRON- as by magnetic wire the life and death throb of the whale so that every oarsman feel -PRON- in -PRON- seat
chapter_81	the next moment relieved in great part from the downward strain at the bow the boat give a sudden bounce upwards as a small icefield will when a dense herd of white bear be scared from -PRON- into the sea
chapter_81	haul in
chapter_81	-PRON- motion plainly denote -PRON- extreme exhaustion
chapter_81	in most land animal there be certain valve or flood gate in many of -PRON- vein whereby when wound the blood be in some degree at least instantly shut off in certain direction
chapter_81	not so with the whale one of whose peculiarity -PRON- be to have an entire non valvular structure of the blood vessel so that when pierce even by so small a point as a harpoon a deadly drain be at once begin upon -PRON- whole arterial system and when this be heighten by the extraordinary pressure of water at a great distance below the surface -PRON- life may be say to pour from -PRON- in incessant stream
chapter_81	even now when the boat pull upon this whale and perilously draw over -PRON- sway fluke and the lance be dart into -PRON- -PRON- be follow by steady jet from the new make wound which keep continually play while the natural spout hole in -PRON- head be only at interval however rapid send -PRON- affrighted moisture into the air
chapter_81	from this last vent no blood yet come because no vital part of -PRON- have thus far be strike
chapter_81	-PRON- life as -PRON- significantly call -PRON- be untouched
chapter_81	-PRON- eye or rather the place where -PRON- eye have be be behold
chapter_81	as strange misgrown mass gather in the knot hole of the noble oak when prostrate so from the point which the whale 's eye have once occupy now protrude blind bulb horribly pitiable to see
chapter_81	but pity there be none
chapter_81	for all -PRON- old age and -PRON- one arm and -PRON- blind eye -PRON- must die the death and be murder in order to light the gay bridal and other merry makings of man and also to illuminate the solemn church that preach unconditional inoffensiveness by all to all
chapter_81	still roll in -PRON- blood at last -PRON- partially disclose a strangely discoloured bunch or protuberance the size of a bushel low down on the flank
chapter_81	a nice spot cry flask just let -PRON- prick -PRON- there once
chapter_81	
chapter_81	but humane starbuck be too late
chapter_81	at the instant of the dart an ulcerous jet shot from this cruel wound and goad by -PRON- into more than sufferable anguish the whale now spout thick blood with swift fury blindly dart at the craft bespatter -PRON- and -PRON- glory crew all over with shower of gore capsize flask 's boat and mar the bow
chapter_81	-PRON- be -PRON- death stroke
chapter_81	soon while the crew be await the arrival of the ship the body show symptom of sink with all -PRON- treasure unrifled
chapter_81	by very heedful management when the ship draw nigh the whale be transfer to -PRON- side and be strongly secure there by the stiff fluke chain for -PRON- be plain that unless artificially uphold the body would at once sink to the bottom
chapter_81	but as the stump of harpoon be frequently find in the dead body of capture whale with the flesh perfectly heal around -PRON- and no prominence of any kind to denote -PRON- place therefore there must need have be some other unknown reason in the present case fully to account for the ulceration allude to
chapter_81	-PRON- may have be dart by some nor west indian long before america be discover
chapter_81	there be no telling
chapter_81	but a sudden stop be put to further discovery by the ship 's be unprecedentedly drag over sideways to the sea owe to the body 's immensely increase tendency to sink
chapter_81	however starbuck who have the ordering of affair hang on to -PRON- to the last hang on to -PRON- so resolutely indeed that when at length the ship would have be capsize if still persist in lock arm with the body then when the command be give to break clear from -PRON- such be the immovable strain upon the timber head to which the fluke chain and cable be fasten that -PRON- be impossible to cast -PRON- off
chapter_81	to cross to the other side of the deck be like walk up the steep gabled roof of a house
chapter_81	many of the ivory inlaying of -PRON- bulwark and cabin be start from -PRON- place by the unnatural dislocation
chapter_81	in vain handspike and crow be bring to bear upon the immovable fluke chain to pry -PRON- adrift from the timberhead and so low have the whale now settle that the submerge end could not be at all approach while every moment whole ton of ponderosity seem add to the sinking bulk and the ship seem on the point of go over
chapter_81	hold on hold on will not ye
chapter_81	by thunder man -PRON- must do something or go for -PRON-
chapter_81	no use pry there avast -PRON- say with -PRON- handspike and run one of ye for a prayer book and a pen knife and cut the big chain
chapter_81	knife
chapter_81	but a few stroke full of spark be give when the exceed strain effect the rest
chapter_81	with a terrific snap every fastening go adrift the ship right the carcase sink
chapter_81	now this occasional inevitable sinking of the recently kill sperm whale be a very curious thing nor have any fisherman yet adequately account for -PRON-
chapter_81	if the only whale that thus sink be old meagre and broken hearted creature -PRON- pad of lard diminish and all -PRON- bone heavy and rheumatic then -PRON- may with some reason assert that this sinking be cause by an uncommon specific gravity in the fish so sinking consequent upon this absence of buoyant matter in -PRON-
chapter_81	but -PRON- be not so
chapter_81	for young whale in the high health and swell with noble aspiration prematurely cut off in the warm flush and may of life with all -PRON- panting lard about -PRON- even these brawny buoyant hero do sometimes sink
chapter_81	be -PRON- say however that the sperm whale be far less liable to this accident than any other specie
chapter_81	where one of that sort go down twenty right whale do
chapter_81	this difference in the species be no doubt imputable in no small degree to the great quantity of bone in the right whale -PRON- venetian blind alone sometimes weigh more than a ton from this incumbrance the sperm whale be wholly free
chapter_81	but there be instance where after the lapse of many hour or several day the sunken whale again rise more buoyant than in life
chapter_81	but the reason of this be obvious
chapter_81	gas be generate in -PRON- -PRON- swell to a prodigious magnitude become a sort of animal balloon
chapter_81	in the shore whaling on sounding among the bays of new zealand when a right whale give token of sinking -PRON- fasten buoy to -PRON- with plenty of rope so that when the body have go down -PRON- know where to look for -PRON- when -PRON- shall have ascend again
chapter_81	-PRON- be not long after the sinking of the body that a cry be hear from the pequod 's mast head announce that the jungfrau be again lower -PRON- boat though the only spout in sight be that of a fin back belong to the specie of uncapturable whale because of -PRON- incredible power of swimming
chapter_81	nevertheless the fin back 's spout be so similar to the sperm whale 's that by unskilful fisherman -PRON- be often mistaken for -PRON-
chapter_81	and consequently derick and all -PRON- host be now in valiant chase of this unnearable brute
chapter_81	the virgin crowding all sail make after -PRON- four young keel and thus -PRON- all disappear far to leeward still in bold hopeful chase
chapter_81	oh
chapter_81	many be the fin backs and many be the dericks -PRON- friend
chapter_82	the more -PRON- dive into this matter of whaling and push -PRON- research up to the very spring head of -PRON- so much the more be
chapter_82	the gallant perseus a son of jupiter be the first whaleman and to the eternal honour of -PRON- calling be -PRON- say that the first whale attack by -PRON- brotherhood be not kill with any sordid intent
chapter_82	every one know the fine story of perseus and andromeda how the lovely andromeda the daughter of a king be tie to a rock on the sea coast and as leviathan be in the very act of carry -PRON- off perseus the prince of whaleman intrepidly advance harpoon the monster and deliver and marry the maid
chapter_82	-PRON- be an admirable artistic exploit rarely achieve by the good harpooneer of the present day inasmuch as this leviathan be slay at the very first dart
chapter_82	when the romans take joppa the same skeleton be carry to italy in triumph
chapter_82	what seem most singular and suggestively important in this story be this -PRON- be from joppa that jonah set sail
chapter_82	akin to the adventure of perseus and andromeda indeed by some suppose to be indirectly derive from -PRON- be that famous story of st. george and the dragon which dragon -PRON- maintain to have be a whale for in many old chronicle whale and dragon be strangely jumbled together and often stand for each other
chapter_82	thou art as a lion of the water and as a dragon of the sea saith ezekiel hereby plainly mean a whale in truth some version of the bible use that word -PRON-
chapter_82	besides -PRON- would much subtract from the glory of the exploit have st. george but encounter a crawl reptile of the land instead of do battle with the great monster of the deep
chapter_82	any man may kill a snake but only a perseus a st. george a coffin have the heart in -PRON- to march boldly up to a whale
chapter_82	thus then one of -PRON- own noble stamp even a whaleman be the tutelary guardian of england and by good right -PRON- harpooneer of nantucket should be enrol in the most noble order of st. george
chapter_82	-PRON- nowhere appear that -PRON- ever actually harpoon -PRON- fish unless indeed from the inside
chapter_82	nor do hero saint demigod and prophet alone comprise the whole roll of -PRON- order
chapter_82	that wondrous oriental story be now to be rehearse from the shaster which give -PRON- the dread vishnoo one of the three person in the godhead of the hindoos give -PRON- this divine
chapter_82	vishnoo who by the first of -PRON- ten earthly incarnation have for ever set apart and sanctify the whale
chapter_82	when brahma or the god of god saith the shaster resolve to recreate the world after one of -PRON- periodical dissolution -PRON- give birth to vishnoo to preside over the work but the vedas or mystical book whose perusal would seem to have be indispensable to vishnoo before begin the creation and which therefore must have contain something in the shape of practical hint to young architect these vedas be lie at the bottom of the water so vishnoo become incarnate in a whale and sound down in -PRON- to the uttermost depth rescue the sacred volume
chapter_82	be not this
chapter_82	vishnoo a whaleman then even as a man who rid a horse be call a horseman
chapter_82	there be a member roll for -PRON-
chapter_82	what club but the whaleman 's can head off like
chapter_82	that
chapter_83	jonah
chapter_83	now some nantucketers rather distrust this historical story of jonah and the whale
chapter_83	but then there be some sceptical greeks and romans who stand out from the orthodox pagan of -PRON- time equally doubt the story of hercules and the whale and arion and the dolphin and yet -PRON- doubt those tradition do not make those tradition one whit the less fact for all that
chapter_83	one old sag harbor whaleman 's chief reason for question the hebrew story be this
chapter_83	-PRON- be not necessary hint the bishop that -PRON- consider jonah as tomb in the whale 's belly but as temporarily lodge in some part of -PRON- mouth
chapter_83	and this seem reasonable enough in the good bishop
chapter_83	for truly the right whale 's mouth would accommodate a couple of whist table and comfortably seat all the player
chapter_83	possibly too jonah may have ensconce -PRON- in a hollow tooth but on second thought the right whale be toothless
chapter_83	another reason which sag harbor -PRON- go by that name urge for -PRON- want of faith in this matter of the prophet be something obscurely in reference to -PRON- incarcerate body and the whale 's gastric juice
chapter_83	but this objection likewise fall to the ground because a german exegetist suppose that jonah must have take refuge in the float body of a dead whale even as the french soldier in the russian campaign turn -PRON- dead horse into tent and crawl into -PRON-
chapter_83	-PRON- be this if -PRON- remember right jonah be swallow by the whale in the mediterranean sea and after three day -PRON- be vomit up somewhere within three day journey of nineveh a city on the tigris very much more than three day journey across from the near point of the mediterranean coast
chapter_83	how be that
chapter_83	but be there no other way for the whale to land the prophet within that short distance of nineveh
chapter_83	yes
chapter_83	but not to speak of the passage through the whole length of the mediterranean and another passage up the persian gulf and red sea such a supposition would involve the complete circumnavigation of all africa in three day not to speak of the tigris water near the site of nineveh be too shallow for any whale to swim in
chapter_83	but all these foolish argument of old sag harbor only evince -PRON- foolish pride of reason a thing still more reprehensible in -PRON- see that -PRON- have but little learning except what -PRON- have pick up from the sun and the sea
chapter_83	and so -PRON- be
chapter_83	besides to this day the highly enlighten turks devoutly believe in the historical story of jonah
chapter_84	pitchpoling
chapter_84	to make -PRON- run easily and swiftly the axle of carriage be anoint and for much the same purpose some whaler perform an analogous operation upon -PRON- boat -PRON- grease the bottom
chapter_84	-PRON- seem to be work in obedience to some particular presentiment
chapter_84	nor do -PRON- remain unwarranted by the event
chapter_84	towards noon whale be raise but so soon as the ship sail down to -PRON- -PRON- turn and flee with swift precipitancy a disordered flight as of cleopatra 's barge from actium
chapter_84	nevertheless the boat pursue and stubb 's be foremost
chapter_84	by great exertion tashtego at last succeed in plant one iron but the stricken whale without at all sounding still continue -PRON- horizontal flight with add fleetness
chapter_84	such unintermitted straining upon the plant iron must sooner or later inevitably extract -PRON-
chapter_84	-PRON- become imperative to lance the fly whale or be content to lose -PRON-
chapter_84	but to haul the boat up to -PRON- flank be impossible -PRON- swim so fast and furious
chapter_84	what then remain
chapter_84	small sword or broad sword in all -PRON- exercise boast nothing like -PRON-
chapter_84	steel and wood include the entire spear be some ten or twelve foot in length the staff be much slight than that of the harpoon and also of a light material pine
chapter_84	-PRON- be furnish with a small rope call a warp of considerable length by which -PRON- can be haul back to the hand after dart
chapter_84	look at -PRON- -PRON- stand upright in the tossed bow of the fly boat wrapt in fleecy foam the tow whale be forty foot ahead
chapter_84	then hold the lance full before -PRON- waistband 's middle -PRON- level -PRON- at the whale when cover -PRON- with -PRON- -PRON- steadily depress the butt end in -PRON- hand thereby elevate the point till the weapon stand fairly balanced upon -PRON- palm fifteen foot in the air
chapter_84	instead of sparkle water -PRON- now spout red blood
chapter_84	that drive the spigot out of -PRON-
chapter_84	cry stubb
chapter_84	tis july 's immortal fourth all fountain must run wine today
chapter_84	then tashtego lad -PRON- would have ye hold a canakin to the jet and -PRON- would drink round -PRON-
chapter_84	yea verily heart alive -PRON- would brew choice punch in the spread of -PRON- spout hole there and from that live punch bowl quaff the living stuff
chapter_84	again and again to such gamesome talk the dexterous dart be repeat the spear return to -PRON- master like a greyhound hold in skilful leash
chapter_84	the tow line be slacken and the pitchpoler drop astern fold -PRON- hand and mutely watch the monster die
chapter_85	let -PRON- then look at this matter along with some interesting item contingent
chapter_85	but owe to -PRON- marked internal structure which give -PRON- regular lung like a human being 's the whale can only live by inhale the disengage air in the open atmosphere
chapter_85	but -PRON- can not in any degree breathe through -PRON- mouth for in -PRON- ordinary attitude the sperm whale 's mouth be bury at least eight foot beneath the surface and what be still more -PRON- windpipe have no connexion with -PRON- mouth
chapter_85	no -PRON- breathe through -PRON- spiracle alone and this be on the top of -PRON- head
chapter_85	assume -PRON- and -PRON- follow that if all the blood in a man could be aerate with one breath -PRON- may then seal up -PRON- nostril and not fetch another for a considerable time
chapter_85	that be to say -PRON- would then live without breathe
chapter_85	anomalous as -PRON- may seem this be precisely the case with the whale who systematically live by interval -PRON- full hour and more when at the bottom without draw a single breath or so much as in any way inhale a particle of air for remember -PRON- have no gill
chapter_85	how be this
chapter_85	between -PRON- rib and on each side of -PRON- spine -PRON- be supply with a remarkable involve cretan labyrinth of vermicelli like vessel which vessel when -PRON- quit the surface be completely distend with oxygenated blood
chapter_85	the anatomical fact of this labyrinth be indisputable and that the supposition found upon -PRON- be reasonable and true seem the more cogent to -PRON- when -PRON- consider the otherwise inexplicable obstinacy of that leviathan in have his spoutings out as the fisherman phrase -PRON-
chapter_85	this be what -PRON- mean
chapter_85	if unmolested upon rise to the surface the sperm whale will continue there for a period of time exactly uniform with all -PRON- other unmolested rising
chapter_85	now if after -PRON- fetch a few breath -PRON- alarm -PRON- so that -PRON- sound -PRON- will be always dodge up again to make good -PRON- regular allowance of air
chapter_85	and not till those seventy breath be tell will -PRON- finally go down to stay out -PRON- full term below
chapter_85	now why should the whale thus insist upon have -PRON- spouting out unless -PRON- be to replenish -PRON- reservoir of air ere descend for good
chapter_85	how obvious be -PRON- too that this necessity for the whale 's rise expose -PRON- to all the fatal hazard of the chase
chapter_85	for not by hook or by net could this vast leviathan be catch when sail a thousand fathom beneath the sunlight
chapter_85	in man breathing be incessantly go on one breath only serve for two or three pulsation so that whatev other business -PRON- have to attend to wake or sleep breathe -PRON- must or die -PRON- will
chapter_85	but the sperm whale only breathe about one seventh or sunday of -PRON- time
chapter_85	but what do -PRON- want of -PRON-
chapter_85	furthermore as -PRON- windpipe solely open into the tube of -PRON- spout canal and as that long canal like the grand erie canal be furnished with a sort of lock that open and shut for the downward retention of air or the upward exclusion of water therefore the whale have no voice unless -PRON- insult -PRON- by say that when -PRON- so strangely rumble -PRON- talk through -PRON- nose
chapter_85	but then again what have the whale to say
chapter_85	seldom have -PRON- know any profound be that have anything to say to this world unless force to stammer out something by way of get a living
chapter_85	oh happy that the world be such an excellent listener
chapter_85	-PRON- be certain that the mouth indirectly communicate with the spout canal but -PRON- can not be prove that this be for the purpose of discharge water through the spiracle
chapter_85	because the great necessity for so do would seem to be when in feed -PRON- accidentally take in water
chapter_85	but the sperm whale 's food be far beneath the surface and there -PRON- can not spout even if -PRON- would
chapter_85	but why pester one with all this reasoning on the subject
chapter_85	-PRON- have see -PRON- spout then declare what the spout be can -PRON- not tell water from air
chapter_85	-PRON- dear sir in this world -PRON- be not so easy to settle these plain thing
chapter_85	and as for this whale spout -PRON- may almost stand in -PRON- and yet be undecided as to what -PRON- be precisely
chapter_85	and if at such time -PRON- should think that -PRON- really perceive drop of moisture in the spout how do -PRON- know that -PRON- be not merely condense from -PRON- vapour or how do -PRON- know that -PRON- be not those identical drop superficially lodge in the spout hole fissure which be countersink into the summit of the whale 's head
chapter_85	for even when tranquilly swim through the mid day sea in a calm with -PRON- elevated hump sun dry as a dromedary 's in the desert even then the whale always carry a small basin of water on -PRON- head as under a blaze sun -PRON- will sometimes see a cavity in a rock fill up with rain
chapter_85	nor be -PRON- at all prudent for the hunter to be over curious touching the precise nature of the whale spout
chapter_85	-PRON- can not go with -PRON- pitcher to this fountain and fill -PRON- and bring -PRON- away
chapter_85	for even when come into slight contact with the outer vapoury shred of the jet which will often happen -PRON- skin will feverishly smart from the acridness of the thing so touch -PRON-
chapter_85	another thing -PRON- have hear -PRON- say and -PRON- do not much doubt -PRON- that if the jet be fairly spout into -PRON- eye -PRON- will blind -PRON-
chapter_85	the wise thing the investigator can do then -PRON- seem to -PRON- be to let this deadly spout alone
chapter_85	still -PRON- can hypothesize even if -PRON- can not prove and establish
chapter_85	-PRON- hypothesis be this that the spout be nothing but mist
chapter_85	and besides other reason to this conclusion -PRON- be impel by consideration touch the great inherent dignity and sublimity of the sperm whale
chapter_85	-PRON- account -PRON- no common shallow being inasmuch as -PRON- be an undisputed fact that -PRON- be never find on sounding or near shore all other whale sometimes be
chapter_85	-PRON- be both ponderous and profound
chapter_85	and -PRON- be convinced that from the head of all ponderous profound being such as plato pyrrho the devil jupiter dante and so on there always go up a certain semi visible steam while in the act of think deep thought
chapter_85	the invariable moisture of -PRON- hair while plunge in deep thought after six cup of hot tea in -PRON- thin shingled attic of an august noon this seem an additional argument for the above supposition
chapter_85	and how nobly -PRON- raise -PRON- conceit of the mighty misty monster to behold -PRON- solemnly sail through a calm tropical sea -PRON- vast mild head overhung by a canopy of vapour engender by -PRON- incommunicable contemplation and that vapour as -PRON- will sometimes see -PRON- glorify by a rainbow as if heaven -PRON- have put -PRON- seal upon -PRON- thought
chapter_85	for d'ye see rainbow do not visit the clear air -PRON- only irradiate vapour
chapter_85	and so through all the thick mist of the dim doubt in -PRON- mind divine intuition now and then shoot enkindle -PRON- fog with a heavenly ray
chapter_85	and for this -PRON- thank god for all have doubt many deny but doubt or denial few along with -PRON- have intuition
chapter_85	doubt of all thing earthly and intuition of some thing heavenly this combination make neither believer nor infidel but make a man who regard -PRON- both with equal eye
chapter_86	the tail
chapter_86	at the crotch or junction these fluke slightly overlap then sideways recede from each other like wing leave a wide vacancy between
chapter_86	in no living thing be the line of beauty more exquisitely define than in the crescentic border of these fluke
chapter_86	at -PRON- utmost expansion in the full grown whale the tail will considerably exceed twenty foot across
chapter_86	this triune structure as much as anything else impart power to the tail
chapter_86	to the student of old roman wall the middle layer will furnish a curious parallel to the thin course of tile always alternate with the stone in those wonderful relic of the antique and which undoubtedly contribute so much to the great strength of the masonry
chapter_86	but as if this vast local power in the tendinous tail be not enough the whole bulk of the leviathan be knit over with a warp and woof of muscular fibre and filament which pass on either side the loin and run down into the fluke insensibly blend with -PRON- and largely contribute to -PRON- might so that in the tail the confluent measureless force of the whole whale seem concentrated to a point
chapter_86	nor do this -PRON- amazing strength at all tend to cripple the graceful flexion of -PRON- motion where infantileness of ease undulate through a titanism of power
chapter_86	on the contrary those motion derive -PRON- most appalling beauty from -PRON-
chapter_86	real strength never impair beauty or harmony but -PRON- often bestow -PRON- and in everything imposingly beautiful strength have much to do with the magic
chapter_86	when angelo paint even god the father in human form mark what robustness be there
chapter_86	and whatev -PRON- may reveal of the divine love in the son the soft curl hermaphroditical italian picture in which -PRON- idea have be most successfully embody these picture so destitute as -PRON- be of all brawniness hint nothing of any power but the mere negative feminine one of submission and endurance which on all hand -PRON- be concede form the peculiar practical virtue of -PRON- teaching
chapter_86	such be the subtle elasticity of the organ -PRON- treat of that whether wield in sport or in earnest or in anger whatev be the mood -PRON- be in -PRON- flexion be invariably mark by exceed grace
chapter_86	five great motion be peculiar to -PRON-
chapter_86	first when use as a fin for progression second when use as a mace in battle third in sweeping fourth in lobtail fifth in peak fluke
chapter_86	in man or fish wriggle be a sign of inferiority
chapter_86	to the whale -PRON- tail be the sole mean of propulsion
chapter_86	-PRON- side fin only serve to steer by
chapter_86	second -PRON- be a little significant that while one sperm whale only fight another sperm whale with -PRON- head and jaw nevertheless in -PRON- conflict with man -PRON- chiefly and contemptuously use -PRON- tail
chapter_86	in strike at a boat -PRON- swiftly curve away -PRON- fluke from -PRON- and the blow be only inflict by the recoil
chapter_86	no rib of man or boat can withstand -PRON-
chapter_86	-PRON- only salvation lie in elude -PRON- but if -PRON- come sideways through the oppose water then partly owe to the light buoyancy of the whale boat and the elasticity of -PRON- material a cracked rib or a dashed plank or two a sort of stitch in the side be generally the most serious result
chapter_86	these submerge side blow be so often receive in the fishery that -PRON- be account mere child 's play
chapter_86	some one strip off a frock and the hole be stop
chapter_86	this delicacy be chiefly evince in the action of sweeping when in maidenly gentleness the whale with a certain soft slowness move -PRON- immense fluke from side to side upon the surface of the sea and if -PRON- feel but a sailor 's whisker woe to that sailor whisker and all
chapter_86	what tenderness there be in that preliminary touch
chapter_86	on more account than one a pity -PRON- be that the whale do not possess this prehensile virtue in -PRON- tail for -PRON- have hear of yet another elephant that when wound in the fight curve round -PRON- trunk and extract the dart
chapter_86	the broad palm of -PRON- tail be flirt high into the air then smiting the surface the thunderous concussion resound for mile
chapter_86	-PRON- would almost think a great gun have be discharge and if -PRON- notice the light wreath of vapour from the spiracle at -PRON- other extremity -PRON- would think that that be the smoke from the touch hole
chapter_86	fifth as in the ordinary float posture of the leviathan the fluke lie considerably below the level of -PRON- back -PRON- be then completely out of sight beneath the surface but when -PRON- be about to plunge into the deep -PRON- entire fluke with at least thirty foot of -PRON- body be toss erect in the air and so remain vibrate a moment till -PRON- downwards shoot out of view
chapter_86	except the sublime breach somewhere else to be describe this peaking of the whale 's fluke be perhaps the grand sight to be see in all animate nature
chapter_86	out of the bottomless profundity the gigantic tail seem spasmodically snatch at the high heaven
chapter_86	so in dream have -PRON- see majestic satan thrust forth -PRON- tormented colossal claw from the flame baltic of hell
chapter_86	but in gaze at such scene -PRON- be all in all what mood -PRON- be in if in the dantean the devil will occur to -PRON- if in that of isaiah the archangel
chapter_86	stand at the mast head of -PRON- ship during a sunrise that crimson sky and sea -PRON- once see a large herd of whale in the east all head towards the sun and for a moment vibrate in concert with peaked fluke
chapter_86	as -PRON- seem to -PRON- at the time such a grand embodiment of adoration of the god be never behold even in persia the home of the fire worshipper
chapter_86	for as the mighty elephant be but a terrier to leviathan so compare with leviathan 's tail -PRON- trunk be but the stalk of a lily
chapter_86	the most direful blow from the elephant 's trunk be as the playful tap of a fan compare with the measureless crush and crash of the sperm whale 's ponderous fluke which in repeat instance have one after the other hurl entire boat with all -PRON- oar and crew into the air very much as an indian juggler toss -PRON- ball
chapter_86	
chapter_86	though all comparison in the way of general bulk between the whale and the elephant be preposterous inasmuch as in that particular the elephant stand in much the same respect to the whale that a dog do to the elephant nevertheless there be not want some point of curious similitude among these be the spout
chapter_86	the more -PRON- consider this mighty tail the more do -PRON- deplore -PRON- inability to express -PRON-
chapter_86	at time there be gesture in -PRON- which though -PRON- would well grace the hand of man remain wholly inexplicable
chapter_86	in an extensive herd so remarkable occasionally be these mystic gesture that -PRON- have hear hunter who have declare -PRON- akin to free mason sign and symbol that the whale indeed by these method intelligently converse with the world
chapter_86	but if -PRON- know not even the tail of this whale how understand -PRON- head
chapter_86	much more how comprehend -PRON- face when face -PRON- have none
chapter_86	thou shalt see -PRON- back part -PRON- tail -PRON- seem to say but -PRON- face shall not be see
chapter_86	but -PRON- can not completely make out -PRON- back part and hint what -PRON- will about -PRON- face -PRON- say again -PRON- have no face
chapter_87	the grand armada
chapter_87	the long and narrow peninsula of malacca extend south eastward from the territory of birmah form the most southerly point of all asia
chapter_87	in a continuous line from that peninsula stretch the long island of sumatra java bally and timor which with many other form a vast mole or rampart lengthwise connect asia with australia and divide the long unbroken indian ocean from the thickly stud oriental archipelago
chapter_87	this rampart be pierce by several sally port for the convenience of ship and whale conspicuous among which be the strait of sunda and malacca
chapter_87	by the strait of sunda chiefly vessel bind to china from the west emerge into the china sea
chapter_87	those narrow strait of sunda divide sumatra from java and stand midway in that vast rampart of island buttress by that bold green promontory know to seaman as java head -PRON- not a little correspond to the central gateway opening into some vast walled empire and consider the inexhaustible wealth of spice and silk and jewel and gold and ivory with which the thousand island of that oriental sea be enrich -PRON- seem a significant provision of nature that such treasure by the very formation of the land should at least bear the appearance however ineffectual of be guard from the all grasp western world
chapter_87	unlike the danes these orientals do not demand the obsequious homage of lower top sail from the endless procession of ship before the wind which for century past by night and by day have pass between the island of sumatra and java freight with the costly cargo of the east
chapter_87	time out of mind the piratical proas of the malays lurk among the low shade cove and islet of sumatra have sally out upon the vessel sail through the strait fiercely demand tribute at the point of -PRON- spear
chapter_87	though by the repeat bloody chastisement -PRON- have receive at the hand of european cruiser the audacity of these corsair have of late be somewhat repressed yet even at the present day -PRON- occasionally hear of english and american vessel which in those water have be remorselessly board and pillage
chapter_87	with a fair fresh wind the pequod be now draw nigh to these strait ahab purpose to pass through -PRON- into the javan sea and thence cruise northwards over water know to be frequent here and there by the sperm whale sweep inshore by the philippine islands and gain the far coast of japan in time for the great whaling season there
chapter_87	do -PRON- crew drink air
chapter_87	nay
chapter_87	so ahab
chapter_87	mark this too in the whaler
chapter_87	-PRON- have a whole lake 's content bottle in -PRON- ample hold
chapter_87	-PRON- carry year water in -PRON-
chapter_87	hence -PRON- be that while other ship may have go to china from new york and back again touch at a score of port the whale ship in all that interval may not have sight one grain of soil -PRON- crew have see no man but float seaman like -PRON-
chapter_87	"so that do -PRON- carry -PRON- the news that another flood have come -PRON- would only answer--""well boy here be the ark"
chapter_87	but though the green palmy cliff of the land soon loom on the starboard bow and with delighted nostril the fresh cinnamon be snuff in the air yet not a single jet be descry
chapter_87	but here be -PRON- premise that owe to the unwearied activity with which of late -PRON- have be hunt over all four ocean the sperm whales instead of almost invariably sail in small detached company as in former time be now frequently meet with in extensive herd sometimes embrace so great a multitude that -PRON- would almost seem as if numerous nation of -PRON- have swear solemn league and covenant for mutual assistance and protection
chapter_87	to this aggregation of the sperm whale into such immense caravan may be impute the circumstance that even in the good cruising ground -PRON- may now sometimes sail for week and month together without be greet by a single spout and then be suddenly salute by what sometimes seem thousand on thousand
chapter_87	broad on both bow at the distance of some two or three mile and form a great semicircle embrace one half of the level horizon a continuous chain of whale jet be up play and sparkle in the noon day air
chapter_87	see from the pequod 's deck then as -PRON- would rise on a high hill of the sea this host of vapoury spout individually curl up into the air and behold through a blend atmosphere of bluish haze show like the thousand cheerful chimney of some dense metropolis descry of a balmy autumnal morning by some horseman on a height
chapter_87	if the wind only hold little doubt have -PRON- that chase through these straits of sunda the vast host would only deploy into the oriental sea to witness the capture of not a few of -PRON- number
chapter_87	correspond to the crescent in -PRON- van -PRON- behold another in -PRON- rear

chapter_87	but thought like these troubled very few of the reckless crew and when after steadily drop and drop the pirate astern the pequod at last shot by the vivid green cockatoo point on the sumatra side emerge at last upon the broad water beyond then the harpooneer seem more to grieve that the swift whale have be gain upon the ship than to rejoice that the ship have so victoriously gain upon the malays
chapter_87	but no sooner do the herd by some presumed wonderful instinct of the sperm whale become notify of the three keel that be after -PRON- though as yet a mile in -PRON- rear than -PRON- rally again and form in close rank and battalion so that -PRON- spout all look like flash line of stacked bayonet move on with redoubled velocity strip to -PRON- shirt and drawer -PRON- spring to the white ash and after several hour pulling be almost dispose to renounce the chase when a general pause commotion among the whale give animating token that -PRON- be now at last under the influence of that strange perplexity of inert irresolution which when the fisherman perceive -PRON- in the whale -PRON- say -PRON- be galli
chapter_87	the compact martial column in which -PRON- have be hitherto rapidly and steadily swimming be now break up in one measureless rout and like king porus elephant in the indian battle with alexander -PRON- seem go mad with consternation

chapter_87	though banding together in ten of thousand the lion maned buffalo of the west have flee before a solitary horseman
chapter_87	witness too all human being how when herd together in the sheepfold of a theatre 's pit -PRON- will at the slight alarm of fire rush helter skelter for the outlet crowding trampling jamming and remorselessly dash each other to death

chapter_87	in about three minute time queequeg 's harpoon be fling the stricken fish dart blind spray in -PRON- face and then run away with -PRON- like light steer straight for the heart of the herd
chapter_87	though such a movement on the part of the whale strike under such circumstance be in no wise unprecedented and indeed be almost always more or less anticipate yet do -PRON- present one of the more perilous vicissitude of the fishery
chapter_87	for as the swift monster drag -PRON- deeper and deep into the frantic shoal -PRON- bid adieu to circumspect life and only exist in a delirious throb

chapter_87	yes -PRON- be now in that enchant calm which -PRON- say lurk at the heart of every commotion
chapter_87	and still in the distracted distance -PRON- behold the tumult of the outer concentric circle and see successive pod of whale eight or ten in each swiftly go round and round like multiplied span of horse in a ring and so closely shoulder to shoulder that a titanic circus rider may easily have over arch the middle one and so have go round on -PRON- back

chapter_87	at any rate though indeed such a test at such a time may be deceptive spouting may be discover from -PRON- low boat that seem play up almost from the rim of the horizon
chapter_87	-PRON- mention this circumstance because as if the cow and calf have be purposely lock up in this innermost fold and as if the wide extent of the herd have hitherto prevent -PRON- from learn the precise because of -PRON- stopping or possibly be so young unsophisticated and every way innocent and inexperienced however -PRON- may have be these small whale now and then visit -PRON- becalmed boat from the margin of the lake evince a wondrous fearlessness and confidence or else a still becharmed panic which -PRON- be impossible not to marvel at
chapter_87	like household dog -PRON- come snuffle round -PRON- right up to -PRON- gunwale and touch -PRON- till -PRON- almost seem that some spell have suddenly domesticate -PRON-

chapter_87	not seldom in the rapid vicissitude of the chase this natural line with the maternal end loose become entangled with the hempen one so that the cub be thereby trap
chapter_87	some of the subtle secret of the sea seem divulge to -PRON- in this enchanted pond
chapter_87	-PRON- see young leviathan amours in the deep
chapter_87	
chapter_87	
chapter_87	the sperm whale as with all other specie of the leviathan but unlike most other fish breed indifferently at all season after a gestation which may probably be set down at nine month produce but one at a time though in some few know instance give birth to an esau and jacob a contingency provide for in suckling by two teat curiously situate one on each side of the anus but the breast -PRON- extend upwards from that
chapter_87	when by chance these precious part in a nursing whale be cut by the hunter 's lance the mother 's pour milk and blood rivallingly discolour the sea for rod
chapter_87	the milk be very sweet and rich -PRON- have be taste by man -PRON- may do well with strawberry
chapter_87	but even so amid the tornadoed atlantic of -PRON- being do -PRON- -PRON- still for ever centrally disport in mute calm and while ponderous planet of unwan woe revolve round -PRON- deep down and deep inland there
chapter_87	meanwhile as -PRON- thus lie entrance the occasional sudden frantic spectacle in the distance evince the activity of the other boat still engage in drug the whale on the frontier of the host or possibly carry on the war within the first circle where abundance of room and some convenient retreat be afford -PRON-
chapter_87	-PRON- be sometimes the custom when fast to a whale more than commonly powerful and alert to seek to hamstring -PRON- as -PRON- be by sunder or maim -PRON- gigantic tail tendon
chapter_87	-PRON- be do by dart a short handle cutting spade to which be attach a rope for haul -PRON- back again
chapter_87	but agonizing as be the wound of this whale and an appalling spectacle enough any way yet the peculiar horror with which -PRON- seem to inspire the rest of the herd be owe to a because which at first the intervene distance obscure from -PRON-
chapter_87	so that torment to madness -PRON- be now churn through the water violently flail with -PRON- flexible tail and toss the keen spade about -PRON- wounding and murder -PRON- own comrade
chapter_87	this terrific object seem to recall the whole herd from -PRON- stationary fright
chapter_87	first the whale form the margin of -PRON- lake begin to crowd a little and tumble against each other as if lift by half spend billow from afar then the lake -PRON- begin faintly to heave and swell
chapter_87	the submarine bridal chamber and nursery vanish in more and more contracting orbit the whale in the more central circle begin to swim in thickening cluster
chapter_87	yes the long calm be depart
chapter_87	"-PRON- intensely whisper seize the helm--""gripe -PRON- oar and clutch -PRON- soul now"

chapter_87	stand up stand up and stay so
chapter_87	the boat be now all but jam between two vast black bulk leave a narrow dardanelle between -PRON- long length
chapter_87	but by desperate endeavor -PRON- at last shot into a temporary opening then give way rapidly and at the same time earnestly watch for another outlet
chapter_87	this lucky salvation be cheaply purchase by the loss of queequeg 's hat who while stand in the bow to prick the fugitive whale have -PRON- hat take clean from -PRON- head by the air eddy make by the sudden tossing of a pair of broad fluke close by
chapter_87	further pursuit be useless but the boat still linger in -PRON- wake to pick up what drugged whale may be drop astern and likewise to secure one which flask have kill and waif
chapter_87	the waif be a pennoned pole two or three of which be carry by every boat and which when additional game be at hand be insert upright into the float body of a dead whale both to mark -PRON- place on the sea and also as token of prior possession should the boat of any other ship draw near
chapter_87	the rest contrive to escape for the time but only to be take as will hereafter be see by some other craft than the pequod
chapter_88	schools and schoolmasters
chapter_88	now though such great body be at time encounter yet as must have be see even at the present day small detach band be occasionally observe embrace from twenty to fifty individual each
chapter_88	-PRON- generally be of two sort those compose almost entirely of female and those muster none but young vigorous male or bull as -PRON- be familiarly designate
chapter_88	in cavalier attendance upon the school of female -PRON- invariably see a male of full grown magnitude but not old who upon any alarm evince -PRON- gallantry by fall in the rear and cover the flight of -PRON- lady
chapter_88	in truth this gentleman be a luxurious ottoman swimming about over the watery world surroundingly accompany by all the solace and endearment of the harem
chapter_88	the contrast between this ottoman and -PRON- concubine be strike because while -PRON- be always of the large leviathanic proportion the lady even at full growth be not more than one third of the bulk of an average sized male
chapter_88	-PRON- be comparatively delicate indeed -PRON- dare say not to exceed half a dozen yard round the waist
chapter_88	-PRON- be very curious to watch this harem and -PRON- lord in -PRON- indolent rambling
chapter_88	like fashionable -PRON- be for ever on the move in leisurely search of variety
chapter_88	by the time -PRON- have lounge up and down the promenade of the equator awhile -PRON- start for the oriental water in anticipation of the cool season there and so evade the other excessive temperature of the year
chapter_88	when serenely advance on one of these journey if any strange suspicious sight be see -PRON- lord whale keep a wary eye on -PRON- interesting family
chapter_88	should any unwarrantably pert young leviathan come that way presume to draw confidentially close to one of the lady with what prodigious fury the bashaw assail -PRON- and chase -PRON- away
chapter_88	high time indeed if unprincipled young rake like -PRON- be to be permit to invade the sanctity of domestic bliss though do what the bashaw will -PRON- can not keep the most notorious lothario out of -PRON- bed for alas all fish bed in common
chapter_88	as ashore the lady often because the most terrible duel among -PRON- rival admirer just so with the whale who sometimes come to deadly battle and all for love
chapter_88	-PRON- fence with -PRON- long low jaw sometimes lock -PRON- together and so strive for the supremacy like elk that warringly interweave -PRON- antler
chapter_88	grant other whale to be in sight the fisherman will seldom give chase to one of these grand turks for these grand turks be too lavish of -PRON- strength and hence -PRON- unctuousness be small
chapter_88	for like certain other omnivorous roving lover that may be name -PRON- lord whale have no taste for the nursery however much for the bower and so be a great traveller -PRON- leave -PRON- anonymous baby all over the world every baby an exotic
chapter_88	-PRON- be therefore not in strict character however admirably satirical that after go to school -PRON- -PRON- should then go abroad inculcate not what -PRON- learn there but the folly of -PRON-
chapter_88	-PRON- title schoolmaster would very naturally seem derive from the name bestow upon the harem -PRON- but some have surmise that the man who first thus entitle this sort of ottoman whale must have read the memoir of vidocq and inform -PRON- what sort of a country schoolmaster that famous frenchman be in -PRON- young day and what be the nature of those occult lesson -PRON- inculcate into some of -PRON- pupil
chapter_88	the same secludedness and isolation to which the schoolmaster whale betak -PRON- in -PRON- advance year be true of all aged sperm whales
chapter_88	almost universally a lone whale as a solitary leviathan be call prove an ancient one
chapter_88	like venerable moss bearded daniel boone -PRON- will have no one near -PRON- but nature -PRON- and -PRON- -PRON- take to wife in the wilderness of water and the good of wife -PRON- be though -PRON- keep so many moody secret
chapter_88	the school compose none but young and vigorous male previously mention offer a strong contrast to the harem school
chapter_88	the forty barrel bull school be large than the harem school
chapter_88	-PRON- soon relinquish this turbulence though and when about three fourth grow break up and separately go about in quest of settlement that is harem
chapter_88	another point of difference between the male and female school be still more characteristic of the sex
chapter_88	say -PRON- strike a forty barrel bull poor devil
chapter_88	all -PRON- comrade quit -PRON-
chapter_88	but strike a member of the harem school and -PRON- companion swim around -PRON- with every token of concern sometimes linger so near -PRON-
chapter_89	fast fish and loose fish
chapter_89	the allusion to the waif and waif pole in the last chapter but one necessitate some account of the law and regulation of the whale fishery of which the waif may be deem the grand symbol and badge
chapter_89	-PRON- frequently happen that when several ship be cruise in company a whale may be strike by one vessel then escape and be finally kill and capture by another vessel and herein be indirectly comprise many minor contingency all partake of this one grand feature
chapter_89	for example after a weary and perilous chase and capture of a whale the body may get loose from the ship by reason of a violent storm and drift far away to leeward be retake by a second whaler who in a calm snugly tow -PRON- alongside without risk of life or line
chapter_89	thus the most vexatious and violent dispute would often arise between the fisherman be there not some write or unwritten universal undisputed law applicable to all case
chapter_89	perhaps the only formal whaling code authorize by legislative enactment be that of holland
chapter_89	i.
chapter_89	a loose fish be fair game for anybody who can soonest catch -PRON-
chapter_89	but what play the mischief with this masterly code be the admirable brevity of -PRON- which necessitate a vast volume of commentary to expound -PRON-
chapter_89	first what be a fast fish
chapter_89	likewise a fish be technically fast when -PRON- bear a waif or any other recognised symbol of possession so long as the party waifing -PRON- plainly evince -PRON- ability at any time to take -PRON- alongside as well as -PRON- intention so to do
chapter_89	these be scientific commentary but the commentary of the whalemen -PRON- sometimes consist in hard word and hard knock the coke upon littleton of the fist
chapter_89	true among the more upright and honourable whaleman allowance be always make for peculiar case where -PRON- would be an outrageous moral injustice for one party to claim possession of a whale previously chase or kill by another party
chapter_89	ultimately the defendant the crew of another ship come up with the whale strike kill seize and finally appropriate -PRON- before the very eye of the plaintiff
chapter_89	and when those defendant be remonstrate with -PRON- captain snap -PRON- finger in the plaintiff tooth and assure -PRON- that by way of doxology to the deed -PRON- have do -PRON- would now retain -PRON- line harpoon and boat which have remain attach to the whale at the time of the seizure
chapter_89	con
chapter_89	case wherein a gentleman after in vain try to bridle -PRON- wife 's viciousness have at last abandon -PRON- upon the sea of life but in the course of year repent of that step -PRON- institute an action to recover possession of -PRON-
chapter_89	these pleading and the counter pleading be duly hear the very learn judge in set term decide to wit that as for the boat -PRON- award -PRON- to the plaintiff because -PRON- have merely abandon -PRON- to save -PRON- life but that with regard to the controverted whale harpoon and line -PRON- belong to the defendant the whale because -PRON- be a loose fish at the time of the final capture and the harpoon and line because when the fish make off with -PRON- -PRON- the fish acquire a property in those article and hence anybody who afterwards take the fish have a right to -PRON-
chapter_89	now the defendant afterwards take the fish ergo the aforesaid article be -PRON-
chapter_89	a common man look at this decision of the very learn judge may possibly object to -PRON-
chapter_89	but plough up to the primary rock of the matter the two great principle lay down in the twin whaling law previously quote and apply and elucidate by lord ellenborough in the above cite case these two law touch fast fish and loose fish -PRON- say will on reflection be find the fundamental of all human jurisprudence for notwithstanding -PRON- complicated tracery of sculpture the temple of the law like the temple of the philistines have but two prop to stand on
chapter_89	but often possession be the whole of the law

chapter_90	heads or tails
chapter_90	bracton l. 3 c. 3
chapter_90	latin from the book of the laws of england which take along with the context mean that of all whale capture by anybody on the coast of that land the king as honourary grand harpooneer must have the head and the queen be respectfully present with the tail
chapter_90	a division which in the whale be much like halve an apple there be no intermediate remainder
chapter_90	now as this law under a modify form be to this day in force in england and as -PRON- offer in various respect a strange anomaly touch the general law of fast and loose fish -PRON- be here treat of in a separate chapter on the same courteous principle that prompt the english railway to be at the expense of a separate car specially reserve for the accommodation of royalty
chapter_90	in the first place in curious proof of the fact that the above mention law be still in force -PRON- proceed to lay before -PRON- a circumstance that happen within the last two year
chapter_90	-PRON- seem that some honest mariner of dover or sandwich or some one of the cinque ports have after a hard chase succeed in kill and beach a fine whale which -PRON- have originally descry afar off from the shore

chapter_90	but the duke have nothing to do with take this fish
chapter_90	
chapter_90	-PRON- have be at great trouble and peril and some expense and be all that to go to the duke 's benefit -PRON- get nothing at all for -PRON- pain but -PRON- blister

chapter_90	thinking that view in some particular light the case may by a bare possibility in some small degree be deem under the circumstance a rather hard one an honest clergyman of the town respectfully address a note to -PRON- grace beg -PRON- to take the case of those unfortunate mariner into full consideration
chapter_90	be this the still militant old man standing at the corner of the three kingdom on all hand coerce alm of beggar
chapter_90	-PRON- will readily be see that in this case the allege right of the duke to the whale be a delegate one from the sovereign
chapter_90	say plowdon the whale so catch belong to the king and queen because of -PRON- superior excellence
chapter_90	a reason for that ye lawyer
chapter_90	now this be write at a time when the black limber bone of the greenland or right whale be largely use in lady bodice
chapter_90	but this same bone be not in the tail -PRON- be in the head which be a sad mistake for a sagacious lawyer like prynne
chapter_90	but be the queen a mermaid to be present with a tail
chapter_90	an allegorical meaning may lurk here
chapter_90	there be two royal fish so style by the english law writer the whale and the sturgeon both royal property under certain limitation and nominally supply the tenth branch of the crown 's ordinary revenue
chapter_90	-PRON- know not that any other author have hint of the matter but by inference -PRON- seem to -PRON- that the sturgeon must be divide in the same way as the whale the king receive the highly dense and elastic head peculiar to that fish which symbolically regarded may possibly be humorously ground upon some presumed congeniality

chapter_91	-PRON- will bet something now say stubb that somewhere hereabouts be some of those drug whale -PRON- tickle the other day
chapter_91	presently the vapour in advance slide aside and there in the distance lie a ship whose furl sail betoken that some sort of whale must be alongside
chapter_91	so intolerable indeed be -PRON- regard by some that no cupidity could persuade -PRON- to moor alongside of -PRON-
chapter_91	in truth -PRON- turn out to be one of those problematical whale that seem to dry up and die with a sort of prodigious dyspepsia or indigestion leave -PRON- defunct body almost entirely bankrupt of anything like oil
chapter_91	nevertheless in the proper place -PRON- shall see that no know fisherman will ever turn up -PRON- nose at such a whale as this however much -PRON- may shun blast whale in general
chapter_91	the pequod have now sweep so nigh to the stranger that stubb vow -PRON- recognise -PRON- cut spade pole entangle in the line that be knotted round the tail of one of these whale

chapter_91	poor devil
chapter_91	for what oil -PRON- will get from that drug whale there would not be fit to burn in a jail no not in a condemn cell
chapter_91	-PRON- wonder now if -PRON- old man have think of that
chapter_91	-PRON- be worth try

chapter_91	issuing from the cabin stubb now call -PRON- boat 's crew and pull off for the stranger
chapter_91	draw across -PRON- bow -PRON- perceive that in accordance with the fanciful french taste the upper part of -PRON- stem piece be carve in the likeness of a huge droop stalk be paint green and for thorn have copper spike project from -PRON- here and there the whole terminating in a symmetrical fold bulb of a bright red colour
chapter_91	upon -PRON- head board in large gilt letter -PRON- read bouton de rose rose button or rose bud and this be the romantic name of this aromatic ship
chapter_91	a wooden rose bud eh
chapter_91	-PRON- cry with -PRON- hand to -PRON- nose that will do very well but how like all creation -PRON- smell
chapter_91	now in order to hold direct communication with the people on deck -PRON- have to pull round the bow to the starboard side and thus come close to the blast whale and so talk over -PRON-
chapter_91	"arrive then at this spot with one hand still to -PRON- nose -PRON- bawled--""bouton de rose ahoy be there any of -PRON- bouton de roses that speak english"
chapter_91	
chapter_91	yes rejoin a guernsey man from the bulwark who turn out to be the chief mate
chapter_91	
chapter_91	what whale
chapter_91	the white whale a sperm whale moby dick have ye see -PRON- never hear of such a whale
chapter_91	cachalot blanche
chapter_91	white whale no
chapter_91	very good then good bye now and -PRON- will call again in a minute
chapter_91	"then rapidly pull back towards the pequod and see ahab lean over the quarter deck rail await -PRON- report -PRON- mould -PRON- two hand into a trumpet and shouted--""no sir"
chapter_91	upon which ahab retire and stubb return to the frenchman
chapter_91	-PRON- now perceive that the guernsey man who have just get into the chain and be use a cutting spade have sling -PRON- nose in a sort of bag
chapter_91	what be the matter with -PRON- nose there say stubb
chapter_91	broke -PRON-
chapter_91	answer the guernsey man who do not seem to relish the job -PRON- be at very much
chapter_91	but what be -PRON- hold yours for
chapter_91	oh nothing
chapter_91	-PRON- be a wax nose -PRON- have to hold -PRON- on
chapter_91	fine day be not -PRON-
chapter_91	roar the guernseyman fly into a sudden passion
chapter_91	oh keep cool cool
chapter_91	yes that be the word
chapter_91	why do not -PRON- pack those whale in ice while -PRON- be work at -PRON-
chapter_91	but joke aside though do -PRON- know rose bud that -PRON- be all nonsense try to get any oil out of such whale
chapter_91	as for that dry up one there -PRON- have not a gill in -PRON- whole carcase
chapter_91	
chapter_91	-PRON- know that well enough but d'ye see the captain here will not believe -PRON- this be -PRON- first voyage -PRON- be a cologne manufacturer before
chapter_91	but come aboard and mayhap -PRON- will believe -PRON- if -PRON- will not -PRON- and so -PRON- will get out of this dirty scrape
chapter_91	the sailor in tasselled cap of red worsted be get the heavy tackle in readiness for the whale
chapter_91	but -PRON- work rather slow and talk very fast and seem in anything but a good humor
chapter_91	all -PRON- nose upwardly project from -PRON- face like so many jib boom
chapter_91	stubb be strike by a shower of outcry and anathema proceed from the captain 's round house abaft and look in that direction see a fiery face thrust from behind the door which be hold ajar from within
chapter_91	this be the tormented surgeon who after in vain remonstrating against the proceeding of the day have betake -PRON- to the captain 's round house cabinet -PRON- call -PRON- to avoid the pest but still could not help yell out -PRON- entreaty and indignation at time
chapter_91	mark all this stubb argue well for -PRON- scheme and turn to the guernsey man have a little chat with -PRON- during which the stranger mate express -PRON- detestation of -PRON- captain as a conceited ignoramus who have bring -PRON- all into so unsavory and unprofitable a pickle
chapter_91	-PRON- therefore hold -PRON- peace on that head but otherwise be quite frank and confidential with -PRON- so that the two quickly concoct a little plan for both circumvent and satirize the captain without -PRON- at all dream of distrust -PRON- sincerity
chapter_91	accord to this little plan of -PRON- the guernsey man under cover of an interpreter 's office be to tell the captain what -PRON- pleased but as come from stubb and as for stubb -PRON- be to utter any nonsense that should come uppermost in -PRON- during the interview
chapter_91	by this time -PRON- destine victim appear from -PRON- cabin
chapter_91	to this gentleman stubb be now politely introduce by the guernsey man who at once ostentatiously put on the aspect of interpret between -PRON-
chapter_91	what shall -PRON- say to -PRON- first
chapter_91	say -PRON- why say stubb eye the velvet vest and the watch and seal -PRON- may as well begin by tell -PRON- that -PRON- look a sort of babyish to -PRON- though -PRON- do not pretend to be a judge
chapter_91	-PRON- say monsieur say the guernsey man in french turn to -PRON- captain that only yesterday -PRON- ship speak a vessel whose captain and chief mate with six sailor have all die of a fever catch from a blast whale -PRON- have bring alongside
chapter_91	
chapter_91	upon this the captain start and eagerly desire to know more
chapter_91	what now say the guernsey man to stubb
chapter_91	in fact tell -PRON- from -PRON- -PRON- be a baboon
chapter_91	-PRON- vow and declare monsieur that the other whale the dry one be far more deadly than the blast one in fine monsieur -PRON- conjure -PRON- as -PRON- value -PRON- life to cut loose from these fish
chapter_91	what now say the guernsey man when the captain have return to -PRON-
chapter_91	why let -PRON- see yes -PRON- may as well tell -PRON- now that that in fact tell -PRON- -PRON- have diddle -PRON- and aside to -PRON- perhaps somebody else
chapter_91	-PRON- say monsieur that -PRON- be very happy to have be of any service to -PRON-
chapter_91	-PRON- want -PRON- to take a glass of wine with -PRON- say the interpreter
chapter_91	by this time stubb be over the side and get into -PRON- boat hail the guernsey man to this effect that have a long tow line in -PRON- boat -PRON- would do what -PRON- could to help -PRON- by pull out the light whale of the two from the ship 's side
chapter_91	while the frenchman 's boat then be engage in tow the ship one way stubb benevolently tow away at -PRON- whale the other way ostentatiously slack out a most unusually long tow line
chapter_91	presently a breeze spring up stubb feign to cast off from the whale hoist -PRON- boat the frenchman soon increase -PRON- distance while the pequod slide in between -PRON- and stubb 's whale
chapter_91	whereupon
chapter_91	stubb quickly pull to the float body and hail the pequod to give notice of -PRON- intention at once proceed to reap the fruit of -PRON- unrighteous cunning
chapter_91	-PRON- would almost have think -PRON- be dig a cellar there in the sea and when at length -PRON- spade strike against the gaunt rib -PRON- be like turn up old roman tile and pottery bury in fat english loam
chapter_91	-PRON- boat 's crew be all in high excitement eagerly help -PRON- chief and look as anxious as gold hunter
chapter_91	-PRON- have -PRON- -PRON- have -PRON- cry stubb with delight strike something in the subterranean region a purse
chapter_91	a purse
chapter_91	and this good friend be ambergris worth a gold guinea an ounce to any druggist
chapter_91	some six handful be obtain but more be unavoidably lose in the sea and still more perhaps may have be secure be -PRON- not for impatient ahab 's loud command to stubb to desist and come on board else the ship would bid -PRON- good bye
chapter_92	now this ambergris be a very curious substance and so important as an article of commerce that in 1791 a certain nantucket bear captain coffin be examine at the bar of the english house of commons on that subject
chapter_92	for at that time and indeed until a comparatively late day the precise origin of ambergris remain like amber -PRON- a problem to the learn
chapter_92	though the word ambergris be but the french compound for grey amber yet the two substance be quite distinct
chapter_92	for amber though at time find on the sea coast be also dig up in some far inland soil whereas ambergris be never find except upon the sea
chapter_92	besides amber be a hard transparent brittle odorless substance use for mouth piece to pipe for bead and ornament but ambergris be soft waxy and so highly fragrant and spicy that -PRON- be largely use in perfumery in pastile precious candle hair powder and pomatum
chapter_92	who would think then that such fine lady and gentleman should regale -PRON- with an essence find in the inglorious bowel of a sick whale
chapter_92	yet so -PRON- be
chapter_92	by some ambergris be suppose to be the because and by other the effect of the dyspepsia in the whale
chapter_92	how to cure such a dyspepsia -PRON- be hard to say unless by administer three or four boat load of brandreth 's pill and then run out of harm 's way as laborer do in blast rock
chapter_92	-PRON- have forget to say that there be find in this ambergris certain hard round bony plate which at first stubb think may be sailor trowser button but -PRON- afterwards turn out that -PRON- be nothing more than piece of small squid bone embalm in that manner
chapter_92	now that the incorruption of this most fragrant ambergris should be find in the heart of such decay be this nothing
chapter_92	bethink thee of that say of st. paul in corinthians about corruption and incorruption how that -PRON- be sow in dishonour but raise in glory
chapter_92	elsewhere in this volume the slanderous aspersion have be disprove that the vocation of whaling be throughout a slatternly untidy business
chapter_92	but there be another thing to rebut
chapter_92	because those whaleman do not then and do not now try out -PRON- oil at sea as the southern ship have always do but cut up the fresh blubber in small bit thrust -PRON- through the bung hole of large cask and carry -PRON- home in that manner the shortness of the season in those icy seas and the sudden and violent storm to which -PRON- be expose forbid any other course
chapter_92	as -PRON- name import smeer fat berg to put up this village be found in order to afford a place for the blubber of the dutch whale fleet to be try out without be take home to holland for that purpose
chapter_92	-PRON- be a collection of furnace fat kettle and oil shed and when the work be in full operation certainly give forth no very pleasant savor
chapter_92	but all this be quite different with a south sea sperm whaler which in a voyage of four year perhaps after completely fill -PRON- hold with oil do not perhaps consume fifty day in the business of boil out and in the state that -PRON- be cask the oil be nearly scentless
chapter_92	the truth be that live or dead if but decently treat whale as a specie be by no means creature of ill odor nor can whaleman be recognise as the people of the middle age affect to detect a jew in the company by the nose
chapter_92	nor indeed can the whale possibly be otherwise than fragrant when as a general thing -PRON- enjoy such high health take abundance of exercise always out of door though -PRON- be true seldom in the open air
chapter_92	-PRON- say that the motion of a sperm whale 's fluke above water dispense a perfume as when a musk scent lady rustle -PRON- dress in a warm parlor
chapter_92	shall -PRON- liken the sperm whale to for fragrance consider -PRON- magnitude
chapter_93	-PRON- be but some few day after encounter the frenchman that a most significant event befall the most insignificant of the pequod 's crew an event most lamentable and which end in provide the sometimes madly merry and predestinate craft with a living and ever accompanying prophecy of whatev shatter sequel may prove -PRON- own
chapter_93	now in the whale ship -PRON- be not every one that go in the boat
chapter_93	some few hand be reserve call ship keeper whose province -PRON- be to work the vessel while the boat be pursue the whale
chapter_93	-PRON- be so in the pequod with the little negro pippin by nick name pip by abbreviation
chapter_93	for black the year 's calendar should show naught but three hundred and sixty five fourth of julys and new year 's days
chapter_93	but pip love life and all life 's peaceable security so that the panic strike business in which -PRON- have somehow unaccountably become entrap have most sadly blurred -PRON- brightness though as ere long will be see what be thus temporarily subdue in -PRON- in the end be destine to be luridly illumine by strange wild fire that fictitiously show -PRON- off to ten time the natural lustre with which in -PRON- native tolland county in connecticut -PRON- have once enliven many a fiddler 's frolic on the green and at melodious even tide with -PRON- gay ha ha have turn the round horizon into one star bell tambourine
chapter_93	so though in the clear air of day suspend against a blue veined neck the pure water diamond drop will healthful glow yet when the cunning jeweller would show -PRON- the diamond in -PRON- most impressive lustre -PRON- lay -PRON- against a gloomy ground and then light -PRON- up not by the sun but by some unnatural gas
chapter_93	but let -PRON- to the story
chapter_93	-PRON- come to pass that in the ambergris affair stubb 's after oarsman chance so to sprain -PRON- hand as for a time to become quite maimed and temporarily pip be put into -PRON- place
chapter_93	the first time stubb lower with -PRON- pip evince much nervousness but happily for that time escape close contact with the whale and therefore come off not altogether discreditably though stubb observe -PRON- take care afterwards to exhort -PRON- to cherish -PRON- courageousness to the utmost for -PRON- may often find -PRON- needful
chapter_93	the involuntary consternation of the moment cause -PRON- to leap paddle in hand out of the boat and in such a way that part of the slack whale line come against -PRON- chest -PRON- breast -PRON- overboard with -PRON- so as to become entangled in -PRON- when at last plumping into the water
chapter_93	that instant the stricken whale start on a fierce run the line swiftly straighten and presto
chapter_93	poor pip come all foam up to the chock of the boat remorselessly drag there by the line which have take several turn around -PRON- chest and neck
chapter_93	-PRON- be full of the fire of the hunt
chapter_93	snatch the boat knife from -PRON- sheath -PRON- suspend -PRON- sharp edge over the line and turn towards stubb exclaim interrogatively cut
chapter_93	meantime pip 's blue choke face plainly look do for god 's sake
chapter_93	all pass in a flash
chapter_93	in less than half a minute this entire thing happen
chapter_93	roar stubb and so the whale be lose and pip be save
chapter_93	so soon as -PRON- recover -PRON- the poor little negro be assail by yell and execration from the crew
chapter_93	the substance be never jump from a boat pip except but all the rest be indefinite as the sound advice ever be
chapter_93	bear that in mind and do not jump any more
chapter_93	hereby perhaps stubb indirectly hint that though man love -PRON- fellow yet man be a money make animal which propensity too often interfere with -PRON- benevolence
chapter_93	bob up and down in that sea pip 's ebon head show like a head of clove
chapter_93	no boat knife be lift when -PRON- fall so rapidly astern
chapter_93	in three minute a whole mile of shoreless ocean be between pip and stubb
chapter_93	out from the centre of the sea poor pip turn -PRON- crisp curling black head to the sun another lonely castaway though the lofty and the bright now in calm weather to swim in the open ocean be as easy to the practise swimmer as to ride in a spring carriage ashore
chapter_93	but the awful lonesomeness be intolerable
chapter_93	the intense concentration of self in the middle of such a heartless immensity -PRON- god who can tell -PRON-
chapter_93	mark how when sailor in a dead calm bathe in the open sea mark
chapter_93	how closely -PRON- hug -PRON- ship and only coast along -PRON- side
chapter_93	but have stubb really abandon the poor little negro to -PRON- fate
chapter_93	no -PRON- do not mean to at least
chapter_93	but -PRON- so happen that those boat without see pip suddenly spy whale close to -PRON- on one side turn and give chase and stubb 's boat be now so far away and -PRON- and all -PRON- crew so intent upon -PRON- fish that pip 's ringed horizon begin to expand around -PRON- miserably
chapter_93	by the mere chance the ship -PRON- at last rescue -PRON- but from that hour the little negro go about the deck an idiot such at least -PRON- say -PRON- be
chapter_93	not drown entirely though
chapter_93	so man 's insanity be heaven 's sense and wander from all mortal reason man come at last to that celestial thought which to reason be absurd and frantic and weal or woe feel then uncompromised indifferent as -PRON- god
chapter_93	the thing be common in that fishery and in the sequel of the narrative -PRON- will then be see what like abandonment befall -PRON-
chapter_94	that whale of stubb 's so dearly purchase be duly bring to the pequod 's side where all those cut and hoist operation previously detail be regularly go through even to the baling of the heidelburgh tun or case
chapter_94	while some be occupy with this latter duty other be employ in drag away the large tub so soon as fill with the sperm and when the proper time arrive this same sperm be carefully manipulate ere go to the try work of which anon
chapter_94	-PRON- have cool and crystallize to such a degree that when with several other -PRON- sit down before a large constantine 's bath of -PRON- -PRON- find -PRON- strangely concrete into lump here and there roll about in the liquid part
chapter_94	a sweet and unctuous duty
chapter_94	such a softener
chapter_94	such a delicious molifier
chapter_94	as -PRON- sit there at -PRON- ease cross legged on the deck after the bitter exertion at the windlass under a blue tranquil sky the ship under indolent sail and glide so serenely along
chapter_94	as -PRON- bath -PRON- hand among those soft gentle globule of infiltrate tissue weave almost within the hour as -PRON- richly break to -PRON- finger and discharge all -PRON- opulence like fully ripe grape -PRON- wine as -PRON- snuff up that uncontaminated aroma literally and truly like the smell of spring violet -PRON- declare to -PRON- that for the time -PRON- live as in a musky meadow -PRON- forget all about -PRON- horrible oath in that inexpressible sperm -PRON- wash -PRON- hand and -PRON- heart of -PRON- -PRON- almost begin to credit the old paracelsan superstition that sperm be of rare virtue in allay the heat of anger while bath in that bath -PRON- feel divinely free from all ill will or petulance or malice of any sort whatsoever
chapter_94	squeeze squeeze squeeze
chapter_94	all the morning long -PRON- squeeze that sperm till -PRON- -PRON- almost melt into -PRON- -PRON- squeeze that sperm till a strange sort of insanity come over -PRON- and -PRON- find -PRON- unwittingly squeeze -PRON- co laborer hand in -PRON- mistake -PRON- hand for the gentle globule
chapter_94	oh
chapter_94	-PRON- dear fellow being why should -PRON- longer cherish any social acerbity or know the slight ill humor or envy
chapter_94	come let -PRON- squeeze hand all round nay let -PRON- all squeeze -PRON- into each other let -PRON- squeeze -PRON- universally into the very milk and sperm of kindness
chapter_94	would that -PRON- could keep squeeze that sperm for ever
chapter_94	for now since by many prolong repeated experience -PRON- have perceive that in all case man must eventually lower or at least shift -PRON- conceit of attainable felicity not place -PRON- anywhere in the intellect or the fancy but in the wife the heart the bed the table the saddle the fireside the country now that -PRON- have perceive all this -PRON- be ready to squeeze case eternally
chapter_94	in thought of the vision of the night -PRON- see long row of angel in paradise each with -PRON- hand in a jar of spermaceti
chapter_94	now while discourse of sperm -PRON- behoove to speak of other thing akin to -PRON- in the business of prepare the sperm whale for the try work
chapter_94	first come white horse so call which be obtain from the taper part of the fish and also from the thick portion of -PRON- fluke
chapter_94	-PRON- be tough with congealed tendon a wad of muscle but still contain some oil
chapter_94	after be sever from the whale the white horse be first cut into portable oblong ere go to the mincer
chapter_94	-PRON- look much like block of berkshire marble
chapter_94	-PRON- be a most refreshing convivial beautiful object to behold
chapter_94	as -PRON- name import -PRON- be of an exceedingly rich mottled tint with a bestreak snowy and golden ground dot with spot of the deep crimson and purple
chapter_94	-PRON- be plum of ruby in picture of citron
chapter_94	spite of reason -PRON- be hard to keep -PRON- from eat -PRON-
chapter_94	-PRON- taste something as -PRON- should conceive a royal cutlet from the thigh of louis le gros may have taste suppose -PRON- to have be kill the first day after the venison season and that particular venison season contemporary with an unusually fine vintage of the vineyard of champagne
chapter_94	there be another substance and a very singular one which turn up in the course of this business but which -PRON- feel -PRON- to be very puzzle adequately to describe
chapter_94	-PRON- be call slobgollion an appellation original with the whaleman and even so be the nature of the substance
chapter_94	-PRON- be an ineffably oozy stringy affair most frequently find in the tub of sperm after a prolong squeezing and subsequent decanting
chapter_94	gurry so call be a term properly belong to right whaleman but sometimes incidentally use by the sperm fisherman
chapter_94	strictly this word be not indigenous to the whale 's vocabulary
chapter_94	but as apply by whaleman -PRON- become so
chapter_94	a whaleman 's nipper be a short firm strip of tendinous stuff cut from the taper part of leviathan 's tail -PRON- average an inch in thickness and for the rest be about the size of the iron part of a hoe
chapter_94	edgewise move along the oily deck -PRON- operate like a leathern squilgee and by nameless blandishment as of magic allure along with -PRON- all impurity
chapter_94	but to learn all about these recondite matter -PRON- good way be at once to descend into the blubber room and have a long talk with -PRON- inmate
chapter_94	this place have previously be mention as the receptacle for the blanket piece when stript and hoist from the whale
chapter_94	when the proper time arrive for cut up -PRON- content this apartment be a scene of terror to all tiro especially by night
chapter_94	on one side light by a dull lantern a space have be leave clear for the workman
chapter_94	-PRON- generally go in pair a pike and gaffman and a spade man
chapter_94	the whaling pike be similar to a frigate 's boarding weapon of the same name
chapter_94	the gaff be something like a boat hook
chapter_94	meanwhile the spade man stand on the sheet -PRON- perpendicularly chop -PRON- into the portable horse piece
chapter_94	if -PRON- cut off one of -PRON- own toe or one of -PRON- assistant would -PRON- be very much astonished
chapter_94	toes be scarce among veteran blubber room man
chapter_95	the cassock
chapter_95	have -PRON- step on board the pequod at a certain juncture of this post mortemizing of the whale and have -PRON- stroll forward nigh the windlass pretty sure be -PRON- that -PRON- would have scan with no small curiosity a very strange enigmatical object which -PRON- would have see there lie along lengthwise in the lee scupper
chapter_95	not the wondrous cistern in the whale 's huge head not the prodigy of -PRON- unhinge low jaw not the miracle of -PRON- symmetrical tail none of these would so surprise -PRON- as half a glimpse of that unaccountable cone long than a kentuckian be tall nigh a foot in diameter at the base and jet black as yojo the ebony idol of queequeg
chapter_95	and an idol indeed -PRON- be or rather in old time -PRON- likeness be
chapter_95	such an idol as that find in the secret grove of queen maachah in judea and for worship which king asa -PRON- son do depose -PRON- and destroy the idol and burn -PRON- for an abomination at the brook kedron as darkly set forth in the 15th chapter of the first book of king
chapter_95	look at the sailor call the mincer who now come along and assist by two ally heavily back the grandissimus as the mariner call -PRON- and with bow shoulder stagger off with -PRON- as if -PRON- be a grenadier carry a dead comrade from the field
chapter_95	extend -PRON- upon the forecastle deck -PRON- now proceed cylindrically to remove -PRON- dark pelt as an african hunter the pelt of a boa
chapter_95	this do -PRON- turn the pelt inside out like a pantaloon leg give -PRON- a good stretching so as almost to double -PRON- diameter and at last hang -PRON- well spread in the rigging to dry
chapter_95	ere long -PRON- be take down when remove some three foot of -PRON- towards the pointed extremity and then cut two slit for arm hole at the other end -PRON- lengthwise slip -PRON- bodily into -PRON-
chapter_95	the mincer now stand before -PRON- invest in the full canonical of -PRON- calling
chapter_95	immemorial to all -PRON- order this investiture alone will adequately protect -PRON- while employ in the peculiar function of -PRON- office
chapter_95	array in decent black occupy a conspicuous pulpit intent on bible leaf what a candidate for an archbishopric what a lad for a pope be this mincer
chapter_95	
chapter_95	bible leaf
chapter_96	the try works
chapter_96	besides -PRON- hoist boat an american whaler be outwardly distinguished by -PRON- try work
chapter_96	-PRON- present the curious anomaly of the most solid masonry join with oak and hemp in constitute the complete ship
chapter_96	-PRON- be as if from the open field a brick kiln be transport to -PRON- plank
chapter_96	the try work be plant between the foremast and mainmast the most roomy part of the deck
chapter_96	the timber beneath be of a peculiar strength fit to sustain the weight of an almost solid mass of brick and mortar some ten foot by eight square and five in height
chapter_96	on the flank -PRON- be case with wood and at top completely cover by a large slop batten hatchway
chapter_96	when not in use -PRON- be keep remarkably clean
chapter_96	sometimes -PRON- be polished with soapstone and sand till -PRON- shine within like silver punch bowl
chapter_96	during the night watch some cynical old sailor will crawl into -PRON- and coil -PRON- away there for a nap
chapter_96	these mouth be fit with heavy door of iron
chapter_96	by a tunnel insert at the rear this reservoir be keep replenish with water as fast as -PRON- evaporate
chapter_96	there be no external chimney -PRON- open direct from the rear wall
chapter_96	and here let -PRON- go back for a moment
chapter_96	-PRON- belong to stubb to oversee the business
chapter_96	all ready there
chapter_96	this be an easy thing for the carpenter have be thrust -PRON- shaving into the furnace throughout the passage
chapter_96	after that no wood be use except as a means of quick ignition to the staple fuel
chapter_96	in a word after be try out the crisp shrivelled blubber now call scrap or fritter still contain considerable of -PRON- unctuous property
chapter_96	these fritter feed the flame
chapter_96	like a plethoric burn martyr or a self consume misanthrope once ignite the whale supply -PRON- own fuel and burn by -PRON- own body
chapter_96	-PRON- have an unspeakable wild hindoo odor about -PRON- such as may lurk in the vicinity of funereal pyre
chapter_96	by midnight the work be in full operation
chapter_96	but that darkness be lick up by the fierce flame which at interval fork forth from the sooty flue and illuminate every lofty rope in the rigging as with the famed greek fire
chapter_96	the burn ship drive on as if remorselessly commission to some vengeful deed
chapter_96	so the pitch and sulphur freight brig of the bold hydriote canaris issue from -PRON- midnight harbor with broad sheet of flame for sail bear down upon the turkish frigate and fold -PRON- in conflagration
chapter_96	the hatch remove from the top of the work now afford a wide hearth in front of -PRON-
chapter_96	stand on this be the tartarean shape of the pagan harpooneer always the whale ship 's stoker
chapter_96	with huge pronged pole -PRON- pitch hiss mass of blubber into the scalding pot or stir up the fire beneath till the snaky flame dart curling out of the door to catch -PRON- by the foot
chapter_96	the smoke roll away in sullen heap
chapter_96	to every pitch of the ship there be a pitch of the boil oil which seem all eagerness to leap into -PRON- face

chapter_100	that be to say jack bunger late of the reverend clergy be a strict total abstinence man -PRON- never drink-- water cry the captain -PRON- never drink -PRON- -PRON- be a sort of fit to -PRON- fresh water throw -PRON- into the hydrophobia but go on go on with the arm story
chapter_100	
chapter_100	yes -PRON- may as well say the surgeon coolly
chapter_100	-PRON- be about observe sir before captain boomer 's facetious interruption that spite of -PRON- good and severe endeavor the wound keep get bad and bad the truth be sir -PRON- be as ugly gap wound as surgeon ever see more than two foot and several inch long
chapter_100	-PRON- measure -PRON- with the lead line
chapter_100	in short -PRON- grow black -PRON- know what be threaten and off -PRON- come
chapter_100	"the marlingspike--""that be the captain 's work not -PRON- -PRON- order the carpenter to make -PRON- -PRON- have that club hammer there put to the end to knock some one 's brain out with -PRON- suppose as -PRON- try -PRON- once"
chapter_100	-PRON- fly into diabolical passion sometimes
chapter_100	do ye see this dent sir
chapter_100	"remove -PRON- hat and brush aside -PRON- hair and expose a bowl like cavity in -PRON- skull but which bear not the slight scarry trace or any token of ever have be a wound--""well the captain there will tell -PRON- how that come here -PRON- know"
chapter_100	oh -PRON- solemn rogue -PRON- -PRON- bunger be there ever such another bunger in the watery world
chapter_100	bunger when -PRON- die -PRON- ought to die in pickle -PRON- dog -PRON- should be preserve to future age -PRON- rascal
chapter_100	
chapter_100	what become of the white whale
chapter_100	oh cry the one armed captain oh yes
chapter_100	
chapter_100	twice
chapter_100	but could not fasten
chapter_100	do not want to try to be not one limb enough
chapter_100	what should -PRON- do without this other arm
chapter_100	"very gravely and mathematically bow to each captain in succession--""do -PRON- know gentleman that the digestive organ of the whale be so inscrutably construct by divine providence that -PRON- be quite impossible for -PRON- to completely digest even a man 's arm"
chapter_100	and -PRON- know -PRON- too
chapter_100	but sometimes -PRON- be like the old juggling fellow formerly a patient of mine in ceylon that make believe swallow jack knife once upon a time let one drop into -PRON- in good earnest and there -PRON- stay for a twelvemonth or more when -PRON- give -PRON- an emetic and -PRON- heave -PRON- up in small tack d'ye see
chapter_100	yes captain boomer if -PRON- be quick enough about -PRON- and have a mind to pawn one arm for the sake of the privilege of give decent burial to the other why in that case the arm be yours only let the whale have another chance at -PRON- shortly that be all
chapter_100	
chapter_100	glance at the ivory leg
chapter_100	-PRON- be
chapter_100	but -PRON- will still be hunt for all that
chapter_100	which way head
chapter_100	"avast roar ahab dash -PRON- against the bulwarks--""man the boat"
chapter_100	which way head
chapter_100	
chapter_100	-PRON- be head east -PRON- think
chapter_100	be -PRON- captain crazy
chapter_100	whisper fedallah
chapter_100	but fedallah put a finger on -PRON- lip slide over the bulwark to take the boat 's steering oar and ahab swing the cutting tackle towards -PRON- command the ship 's sailor to stand by to lower
chapter_100	in vain the english captain hail -PRON-
chapter_100	with back to the strange ship and face set like a flint to -PRON- own ahab stand upright till alongside of the pequod
chapter_101	the decanter
chapter_101	how long prior to the year of -PRON- lord 1775 this great whaling house be in existence -PRON- numerous fish document do not make plain but in that year 1775 -PRON- fit out the first english ship that ever regularly hunt the sperm whale though for some score of year previous ever since 1726 -PRON- valiant coffin and maceys of nantucket and the vineyard have in large fleet pursue that leviathan but only in the north and south atlantic not elsewhere
chapter_101	the voyage be a skilful and lucky one and return to -PRON- berth with -PRON- hold full of the precious sperm the amelia 's example be soon follow by other ship english and american and thus the vast sperm whale ground of the pacific be throw open
chapter_101	but not content with this good deed the indefatigable house again bestir -PRON- samuel and all -PRON- sons how many -PRON- mother only know and under -PRON- immediate auspex and partly -PRON- think at -PRON- expense the british government be induce to send the sloop of war rattler on a whaling voyage of discovery into the south sea
chapter_101	command by a naval post captain the rattler make a rattle voyage of -PRON- and do some service how much do not appear
chapter_101	but this be not all
chapter_101	in 1819 the same house fit out a discovery whale ship of -PRON- own to go on a tasting cruise to the remote water of japan
chapter_101	that ship well call the syren make a noble experimental cruise and -PRON- be thus that the great japanese whaling ground first become generally know
chapter_101	the syren in this famous voyage be command by a captain coffin a nantucketer
chapter_101	the ship name after -PRON- be worthy of the honour be a very fast sailer and a noble craft every way
chapter_101	-PRON- board -PRON- once at midnight somewhere off the patagonian coast and drink good flip down in the forecastle
chapter_101	a short life to -PRON- and a jolly death
chapter_101	and that fine gam -PRON- have long very long after old ahab touch -PRON- plank with -PRON- ivory heel -PRON- mind -PRON- of the noble solid saxon hospitality of that ship and may -PRON- parson forget -PRON- and the devil remember -PRON- if -PRON- ever lose sight of -PRON-
chapter_101	do -PRON- say -PRON- have flip
chapter_101	yes and -PRON- flip -PRON- at the rate of ten gallon the hour and when the squall come for -PRON- be squally off there by patagonia and all hand visitor and all be call to reef topsail -PRON- be so top heavy that -PRON- have to swing each other aloft in bowline and -PRON- ignorantly furl the skirt of -PRON- jacket into the sail so that -PRON- hang there reef fast in the howl gale a warning example to all drunken tar
chapter_101	the beef be fine tough but with body in -PRON-
chapter_101	-PRON- say -PRON- be bull beef other that -PRON- be dromedary beef but -PRON- do not know for certain how that be
chapter_101	-PRON- fancy that -PRON- could feel -PRON- and roll -PRON- about in -PRON- after -PRON- be swallow
chapter_101	if -PRON- stoop over too far forward -PRON- risk -PRON- pitching out of -PRON- like billiard ball
chapter_101	the bread but that could not be help besides -PRON- be an anti scorbutic in short the bread contain the only fresh fare -PRON- have
chapter_101	but the forecastle be not very light and -PRON- be very easy to step over into a dark corner when -PRON- eat -PRON-
chapter_101	but why be -PRON- think ye that the samuel enderby and some other english whaler -PRON- know of not all though be such famous hospitable ship that pass round the beef and the bread and the can and the joke and be not soon weary of eat and drinking and laugh
chapter_101	the abound good cheer of these english whaler be matter for historical research
chapter_101	nor have -PRON- be at all sparing of historical whale research when -PRON- have seem need
chapter_101	the english be precede in the whale fishery by the hollanders zealanders and danes from whom -PRON- derive many term still extant in the fishery and what be yet more -PRON- fat old fashion touch plenty to eat and drink
chapter_101	for as a general thing the english merchant ship scrimp -PRON- crew but not so the english whaler
chapter_101	hence in the english this thing of whale good cheer be not normal and natural but incidental and particular and therefore must have some special origin which be here point out and will be still further elucidate
chapter_101	during -PRON- research in the leviathanic history -PRON- stumble upon an ancient dutch volume which by the musty whaling smell of -PRON- -PRON- know must be about whaler
chapter_101	the title be dan coopman wherefore -PRON- conclude that this must be the invaluable memoir of some amsterdam cooper in the fishery as every whale ship must carry -PRON- cooper
chapter_101	-PRON- be reinforce in this opinion by see that -PRON- be the production of one fitz swackhammer
chapter_101	in short this ancient and learn low dutch book treat of the commerce of holland and among other subject contain a very interesting account of -PRON- whale fishery
chapter_101	and in this chapter -PRON- be head smeer or fat that -PRON- find a long detailed list of the outfits for the larder and cellar of 180 sail of dutch whaleman from which list as translate by dr. snodhead -PRON- transcribe the follow 400,000 lb of beef
chapter_101	150,000 lb of stock fish
chapter_101	550,000 lb of biscuit
chapter_101	72,000 lb of soft bread
chapter_101	2,800 firkin of butter
chapter_101	texel leyden cheese
chapter_101	cheese probably an inferior article
chapter_101	550 anker of geneva
chapter_101	most statistical table be parchingly dry in the reading not so in the present case however where the reader be flood with whole pipe barrel quart and gill of good gin and good cheer
chapter_101	at the time -PRON- devote three day to the studious digesting of all this beer beef and bread
chapter_101	during which many profound thought be incidentally suggest to -PRON- capable of a transcendental and platonic application and furthermore -PRON- compile supplementary table of -PRON- own touch the probable quantity of stock fish etc consume by every low dutch harpooneer in that ancient greenland and spitzbergen whale fishery
chapter_101	-PRON- impute -PRON- though to -PRON- naturally unctuous nature be render still more unctuous by the nature of -PRON- vocation and especially by -PRON- pursue -PRON- game in those frigid polar seas on the very coast of that esquimaux country where the convivial native pledge each other in bumper of train oil
chapter_101	the quantity of beer too be very large 10,800 barrel
chapter_101	now as those polar fishery could only be prosecute in the short summer of that climate so that the whole cruise of one of these dutch whaleman include the short voyage to and from the spitzbergen sea do not much exceed three month say and reckon 30 man to each of -PRON- fleet of 180 sail -PRON- have 5,400 low dutch seaman in all therefore -PRON- say -PRON- have precisely two barrel of beer per man for a twelve week allowance exclusive of -PRON- fair proportion of that 550 anker of gin
chapter_101	now whether these gin and beer harpooneer so fuddled as one may fancy -PRON- to have be be the right sort of man to stand up in a boat 's head and take good aim at fly whale this would seem somewhat improbable
chapter_101	yet -PRON- do aim at -PRON- and hit -PRON- too
chapter_101	but no more enough have be say to show that the old dutch whaler of two or three century ago be high liver and that the english whaler have not neglect so excellent an example
chapter_102	a bower in the arsacides
chapter_102	but to a large and thorough sweeping comprehension of -PRON- -PRON- behoove -PRON- now to unbutton -PRON- still further and untagg the point of -PRON- hose unbuckle -PRON- garter and cast loose the hook and the eye of the joint of -PRON- innermost bone set -PRON- before -PRON- in -PRON- ultimatum that be to say in -PRON- unconditional skeleton
chapter_102	how be -PRON- that -PRON- a mere oarsman in the fishery pretend to know aught about the subterranean part of the whale
chapter_102	do erudite stubb mount upon -PRON- capstan deliver lecture on the anatomy of the cetacea and by help of the windlass hold up a specimen rib for exhibition
chapter_102	explain thyself ishmael
chapter_102	can -PRON- land a full grow whale on -PRON- deck for examination as a cook dish a roast pig
chapter_102	a veritable witness have -PRON- hitherto be ishmael but have a care how -PRON- seize the privilege of jonah alone the privilege of discourse upon the joist and beam the rafter ridge pole sleeper and under pinning make up the frame work of leviathan and belike of the tallow vat dairy room buttery and cheeserie in -PRON- bowel
chapter_102	-PRON- confess that since jonah few whaleman have penetrate very far beneath the skin of the adult whale nevertheless -PRON- have be bless with an opportunity to dissect -PRON- in miniature
chapter_102	in a ship -PRON- belong to a small cub sperm whale be once bodily hoist to the deck for -PRON- poke or bag to make sheath for the barb of the harpoon and for the head of the lance
chapter_102	think -PRON- -PRON- let that chance go without use -PRON- boat hatchet and jack knife and break the seal and read all the content of that young cub
chapter_102	and as for -PRON- exact knowledge of the bone of the leviathan in -PRON- gigantic full grown development for that rare knowledge -PRON- be indebted to -PRON- late royal friend tranquo king of tranque one of the arsacides
chapter_102	among many other fine quality -PRON- royal friend tranquo be gifted with a devout love for all matter of barbaric vertu have bring together in pupella whatev rare thing the more ingenious of -PRON- people could invent chiefly carve wood of wonderful device chiselled shell inlaid spear costly paddle aromatic canoe and all these distribute among whatev natural wonder the wonder freight tribute render wave have cast upon -PRON- shore
chapter_102	chief among these latter be a great sperm whale which after an unusually long rag gale have be find dead and strand with -PRON- head against a cocoa nut tree whose plumage like tufted drooping seem -PRON- verdant jet
chapter_102	when the vast body have at last be strip of -PRON- fathom deep enfolding and the bone become dust dry in the sun then the skeleton be carefully transport up the pupella glen where a grand temple of lordly palm now shelter -PRON-
chapter_102	the rib be hang with trophy the vertebrae be carve with arsacidean annal in strange hieroglyphic in the skull the priest keep up an unextinguished aromatic flame so that the mystic head again send forth -PRON- vapoury spout while suspend from a bough the terrific low jaw vibrate over all the devotee like the hair hung sword that so affright damocles
chapter_102	-PRON- be a wondrous sight
chapter_102	the wood be green as moss of the icy glen the tree stand high and haughty feel -PRON- live sap the industrious earth beneath be as a weaver 's loom with a gorgeous carpet on -PRON- whereof the ground vine tendril form the warp and woof and the live flower the figure
chapter_102	all the tree with all -PRON- laden branch all the shrub and fern and grass the message carry air all these unceasingly be active
chapter_102	through the lacing of the leaf the great sun seem a fly shuttle weaving the unwearied verdure
chapter_102	oh busy weaver
chapter_102	unseen weaver!--pause!--one word!--whither flow the fabric
chapter_102	what palace may -PRON- deck
chapter_102	wherefore all these ceaseless toiling
chapter_102	speak weaver!--stay
chapter_102	thy hand!--but one single word with thee
chapter_102	nay
chapter_102	the shuttle fly the figure float from forth the loom the freshet rush carpet for ever slide away
chapter_102	for even so -PRON- be in all material factory
chapter_102	the spoken word that be inaudible among the fly spindle those same word be plainly hear without the wall burst from the open casement
chapter_102	thereby have villainy be detect
chapter_102	ah mortal
chapter_102	then be heedful
chapter_102	for so in all this din of the great world 's loom thy subtle thinking may be overhear afar
chapter_102	now amid the green life restless loom of that arsacidean wood the great white worship skeleton lie lounge a gigantic idler
chapter_102	yet as the ever weave verdant warp and woof intermix and hum around -PRON- the mighty idler seem the cunning weaver -PRON- all weave over with the vine every month assume green fresh verdure but -PRON- a skeleton
chapter_102	life fold death
chapter_102	death trellis life the grim god wive with youthful life and beget -PRON- curly head glory
chapter_102	now when with royal tranquo -PRON- visit this wondrous whale and see the skull an altar and the artificial smoke ascend from where the real jet have issue -PRON- marvel that the king should regard a chapel as an object of vertu
chapter_102	-PRON- laugh
chapter_102	but more -PRON- marvel that the priest should swear that smoky jet of -PRON- be genuine
chapter_102	to and fro -PRON- pace before this skeleton brush the vine aside break through the rib and with a ball of arsacidean twine wander eddy long amid -PRON- many winding shade colonnade and arbour
chapter_102	but soon -PRON- line be out and follow -PRON- back -PRON- emerge from the opening where -PRON- enter
chapter_102	-PRON- see no living thing within naught be there but bone
chapter_102	cut -PRON- a green measuring rod -PRON- once more dive within the skeleton
chapter_102	from -PRON- arrow slit in the skull the priest perceive -PRON- take the altitude of the final rib how now
chapter_102	-PRON- shout dar'st thou measure this -PRON- god
chapter_102	aye priest well how long do ye make -PRON- then
chapter_102	but a fierce contest rise among -PRON- concern foot and inch -PRON- crack each other 's sconce with -PRON- yard stick the great skull echo and seize that lucky chance -PRON- quickly conclude -PRON- own admeasurement
chapter_102	but first be -PRON- record that in this matter -PRON- be not free to utter any fancied measurement -PRON- please
chapter_102	because there be skeleton authority -PRON- can refer to to test -PRON- accuracy
chapter_102	likewise -PRON- have hear that in the museum of manchester in new hampshire -PRON- have what the proprietor call the only perfect specimen of a greenland or river whale in the united states
chapter_102	moreover at a place in yorkshire england burton constable by name a certain sir clifford constable have in -PRON- possession the skeleton of a sperm whale but of moderate size by no mean of the full grow magnitude of -PRON- friend king tranquo 's
chapter_102	sir clifford 's whale have be articulate throughout so that like a great chest of drawer -PRON- can open and shut -PRON- in all -PRON- bony cavity spread out -PRON- rib like a gigantic fan and swing all day upon -PRON- low jaw
chapter_102	locks be to be put upon some of -PRON- trap door and shutter and a footman will show round future visitor with a bunch of key at -PRON- side
chapter_102	sir clifford think of charge twopence for a peep at the whispering gallery in the spinal column threepence to hear the echo in the hollow of -PRON- cerebellum and sixpence for the unrivalled view from -PRON- forehead
chapter_102	the skeleton dimension -PRON- shall now proceed to set down be copy verbatim from -PRON- right arm where -PRON- have -PRON- tattooed as in -PRON- wild wandering at that period there be no other secure way of preserve such valuable statistic
chapter_102	but as -PRON- be crowd for space and wish the other part of -PRON- body to remain a blank page for a poem -PRON- be then compose at least what untattooed part may remain -PRON- do not trouble -PRON- with the odd inch nor indeed should inch at all enter into a congenial admeasurement of the whale
chapter_103	such a statement may prove useful here
chapter_103	accord to a careful calculation -PRON- have make and which -PRON- partly base upon captain scoresby 's estimate of seventy ton for the large sized greenland whale of sixty foot in length accord to -PRON- careful calculation -PRON- say a sperm whale of the large magnitude between eighty five and ninety foot in length and something less than forty foot in -PRON- full circumference such a whale will weigh at least ninety ton so that reckon thirteen man to a ton -PRON- would considerably outweigh the combined population of a whole village of one thousand one hundred inhabitant
chapter_103	think -PRON- not then that brain like yoke cattle should be put to this leviathan to make -PRON- at all budge to any landsman 's imagination
chapter_103	but as the colossal skull embrace so very large a proportion of the entire extent of the skeleton as -PRON- be by far the most complicated part and as nothing be to be repeat concern -PRON- in this chapter -PRON- must not fail to carry -PRON- in -PRON- mind or under -PRON- arm as -PRON- proceed otherwise -PRON- will not gain a complete notion of the general structure -PRON- be about to view
chapter_103	in length the sperm whale 's skeleton at tranque measure seventy two feet
chapter_103	so that when fully invest and extend in life -PRON- must have
chapter_103	be ninety foot long for in the whale the skeleton lose about one fifth in length compare with the live body
chapter_103	of this seventy two foot -PRON- skull and jaw comprise some twenty foot leave some fifty foot of plain back bone
chapter_103	attach to this back bone for something less than a third of -PRON- length be the mighty circular basket of rib which once enclose -PRON- vital
chapter_103	in general thickness -PRON- all bear a seemly correspondence to -PRON- length
chapter_103	the middle rib be the most arched
chapter_103	the large of the tranque rib one of the middle one occupy that part of the fish which in life be great in depth
chapter_103	now the great depth of the invest body of this particular whale must have be at least sixteen foot
chapter_103	besides for some way where -PRON- now see but a naked spine all that have be once wrap round with ton of add bulk in flesh muscle blood and bowel
chapter_103	still more for the ample fin -PRON- here see but a few disordered joint and in place of the weighty and majestic but boneless fluke an utter blank
chapter_103	how vain and foolish then think -PRON- for timid untravelled man to try to comprehend aright this wondrous whale by merely pore over -PRON- dead attenuate skeleton stretch in this peaceful wood
chapter_103	no
chapter_103	only in the heart of quick peril only when within the eddying of -PRON- angry fluke only on the profound unbounded sea can the fully invest whale be truly and livingly find out
chapter_103	but the spine
chapter_103	for that the good way -PRON- can consider -PRON- be with a crane to pile -PRON- bone high up on end
chapter_103	no speedy enterprise
chapter_103	but now -PRON- be do -PRON- look much like pompey 's pillar
chapter_103	there be forty and odd vertebrae in all which in the skeleton be not lock together
chapter_103	-PRON- mostly lie like the great knobbed block on a gothic spire form solid course of heavy masonry
chapter_103	the large a middle one be in width something less than three foot and in depth more than four
chapter_103	thus -PRON- see how that the spine of even the huge of live thing taper off at last into simple child 's play
chapter_104	the fossil whale
chapter_104	from -PRON- mighty bulk the whale afford a most congenial theme whereon to enlarge amplify and generally expatiate
chapter_104	would -PRON- -PRON- could not compress -PRON-
chapter_104	by good right -PRON- should only be treat of in imperial folio
chapter_104	not to tell over again -PRON- furlong from spiracle to tail and the yard -PRON- measure about the waist only think of the gigantic involution of -PRON- intestine where -PRON- lie in -PRON- like great cable and hawser coil away in the subterranean orlop deck of a line of battle ship
chapter_104	since -PRON- have undertake to manhandle this leviathan -PRON- behoove -PRON- to approve -PRON- omnisciently exhaustive in the enterprise not overlook the minute seminal germ of -PRON- blood and spin -PRON- out to the uttermost coil of -PRON- bowel
chapter_104	have already describe -PRON- in most of -PRON- present habitatory and anatomical peculiarity -PRON- now remain to magnify -PRON- in an archaeological fossiliferous and antediluvian point of view
chapter_104	but when leviathan be the text the case be alter
chapter_104	fain be -PRON- to stagger to this emprise under the weighty word of the dictionary
chapter_104	and here be -PRON- say that whenever -PRON- have be convenient to consult one in the course of these dissertation -PRON- have invariably use a huge quarto edition of johnson expressly purchase for that purpose because that famous lexicographer 's uncommon personal bulk more fit -PRON- to compile a lexicon to be use by a whale author like -PRON-
chapter_104	one often hear of writer that rise and swell with -PRON- subject though -PRON- may seem but an ordinary one
chapter_104	how then with -PRON- write of this leviathan
chapter_104	give -PRON- a condor 's quill
chapter_104	give -PRON- vesuvius crater for an inkstand
chapter_104	such and so magnify be the virtue of a large and liberal theme
chapter_104	-PRON- expand to -PRON- bulk
chapter_104	no great and enduring volume can ever be write on the flea though many there be who have try -PRON-
chapter_104	ere enter upon the subject of fossil whales -PRON- present -PRON- credential as a geologist by state that in -PRON- miscellaneous time -PRON- have be a stone mason and also a great digger of ditch canal and well wine vault cellar and cistern of all sort
chapter_104	the subsequent relic discover in what be call the tertiary formation seem the connect or at any rate intercept link between the antichronical creature and those whose remote posterity be say to have enter the ark all the fossil whales hitherto discover belong to the tertiary period which be the last precede the superficial formation
chapter_104	and though none of -PRON- precisely answer to any know specie of the present time -PRON- be yet sufficiently akin to -PRON- in general respect to justify -PRON- take rank as cetacean fossil
chapter_104	among the more curious of such remain be part of a skull which in the year 1779 be disinter in the rue dauphine in paris a short street opening almost directly upon the palace of the tuileries and bone disinter in excavate the great dock of antwerp in napoleon 's time
chapter_104	cuvier pronounce these fragment to have belong to some utterly unknown leviathanic specie
chapter_104	the awe stricken credulous slave in the vicinity take -PRON- for the bone of one of the fallen angel
chapter_104	the alabama doctor declare -PRON- a huge reptile and bestow upon -PRON- the name of basilosaurus
chapter_104	but some specimen bone of -PRON- be take across the sea to owen the english anatomist
chapter_104	-PRON- turn out that this allege reptile be a whale though of a depart specie
chapter_104	a significant illustration of the fact again and again repeat in this book that the skeleton of the whale furnish but little clue to the shape of -PRON- fully invest body
chapter_104	so owen rechristen the monster zeuglodon and in -PRON- paper read before the london geological society pronounce -PRON- in substance one of the most extraordinary creature which the mutation of the globe have blot out of existence
chapter_104	when -PRON- stand among these mighty leviathan skeleton skull tusk jaw rib and vertebrae all characterize by partial resemblance to the exist breed of sea monster but at the same time bear on the other hand similar affinity to the annihilate antichronical leviathans -PRON- incalculable senior -PRON- be by a flood bear back to that wondrous period ere time -PRON- can be say to have begin for time begin with man
chapter_104	then the whole world be the whale 's and king of creation -PRON- leave -PRON- wake along the present line of the andes and the himmalehs
chapter_104	who can show a pedigree like leviathan
chapter_104	ahab 's harpoon have shed old blood than the pharaoh 's
chapter_104	methuselah seem a school boy
chapter_104	-PRON- look round to shake hand with shem
chapter_104	-PRON- be horror strike at this antemosaic unsourced existence of the unspeakable terror of the whale which have be before all time must need exist after all humane age be over
chapter_104	but not alone have this leviathan leave -PRON- pre adamite trace in the stereotype plate of nature and in limestone and marl bequeath -PRON- ancient bust but upon egyptian tablet whose antiquity seem to claim for -PRON- an almost fossiliferous character -PRON- find the unmistakable print of -PRON- fin
chapter_104	in an apartment of the great temple of denderah some fifty year ago there be discover upon the granite ceil a sculptured and paint planisphere abound in centaur griffin and dolphin similar to the grotesque figure on the celestial globe of the modern
chapter_104	nor must there be omit another strange attestation of the antiquity of the whale in -PRON- own osseous post diluvian reality as set down by the venerable john leo the old barbary traveller
chapter_104	not far from the sea side -PRON- have a temple the rafter and beams of which be make of whale bones for whales of a monstrous size be oftentimes cast up dead upon that shore
chapter_104	-PRON- keep a whale 's rib of an incredible length for a miracle which lie upon the ground with -PRON- convex part uppermost make an arch the head of which can not be reach by a man upon a camel 's back
chapter_104	this rib say john leo be say to have layn there a hundred year before -PRON- see -PRON-
chapter_104	-PRON- historian affirm that a prophet who prophesy'd of mahomet come from this temple and some do not stand to assert that the prophet jonas be cast forth by the whale at the base of the temple
chapter_104	in this afric temple of the whale -PRON- leave -PRON- reader and if -PRON- be a nantucketer and a whaleman -PRON- will silently worship there
chapter_105	do the whale 's magnitude diminish
chapter_105	will
chapter_105	inasmuch then as this leviathan come flounder down upon -PRON- from the head water of the eternities -PRON- may be fitly inquire whether in the long course of -PRON- generation -PRON- have not degenerate from the original bulk of -PRON- sire
chapter_105	but upon investigation -PRON- find that not only be the whale of the present day superior in magnitude to those whose fossil remain be find in the tertiary system embrace a distinct geological period prior to man but of the whale find in that tertiary system those belong to -PRON- latter formation exceed in size those of -PRON- early one
chapter_105	and -PRON- have hear on whaleman 's authority that sperm whales have be capture near a hundred foot long at the time of capture
chapter_105	but may -PRON- not be that while the whale of the present hour be an advance in magnitude upon those of all previous geological period may -PRON- not be that since adam 's time -PRON- have degenerate
chapter_105	for pliny tell -PRON- of whales that embrace acre of living bulk and aldrovandus of other which measure eight hundred foot in length rope walks and thames tunnels of whales
chapter_105	and even in the day of banks and solander cooke 's naturalist -PRON- find a danish member of the academy of sciences set down certain iceland whales reydan siskur or wrinkled bellies at one hundred and twenty yard that is three hundred and sixty foot
chapter_105	and lacepede the french naturalist in -PRON- elaborate history of whale in the very beginning of -PRON- work page 3 set down the right whale at one hundred metre three hundred and twenty eight foot
chapter_105	no
chapter_105	the whale of to day be as big as -PRON- ancestor in pliny 's time
chapter_105	and if ever -PRON- go where pliny be -PRON- a whaleman more than -PRON- be will make bold to tell -PRON- so
chapter_105	because -PRON- can not understand how -PRON- be that while the egyptian mummy that be bury thousand of year before even pliny be bear do not measure so much in -PRON- coffin as a modern kentuckian in -PRON- sock and while the cattle and other animal sculpture on the old egyptian and nineveh tablet by the relative proportion in which -PRON- be draw just as plainly prove that the high breed stall feed prize cattle of smithfield not only equal but far exceed in magnitude the fat of pharaoh 's fat kine in the face of all this -PRON- will not admit that of all animal the whale alone should have degenerate
chapter_105	but still another inquiry remain one often agitate by the more recondite nantucketers
chapter_105	but -PRON- must look at this matter in every light
chapter_105	though so short a period ago not a good lifetime the census of the buffalo in illinois exceed the census of man now in london and though at the present day not one horn or hoof of -PRON- remain in all that region and though the because of this wondrous extermination be the spear of man yet the far different nature of the whale hunt peremptorily forbid so inglorious an end to the leviathan
chapter_105	whereas in the day of the old canadian and indian hunter and trapper of the west when the far west in whose sunset sun still rise be a wilderness and a virgin the same number of moccasined man for the same number of month mount on horse instead of sail in ship would have slay not forty but forty thousand and more buffalo a fact that if need be could be statistically state
chapter_105	nor consider aright do -PRON- seem any argument in favour of the gradual extinction of the sperm whale for example that in former year the latter part of the last century say these leviathans in small pod be encounter much oftener than at present and in consequence the voyage be not so prolonged and be also much more remunerative
chapter_105	because as have be elsewhere notice those whale influence by some view to safety now swim the sea in immense caravan so that to a large degree the scatter solitary yoke and pod and school of other day be now aggregate into vast but widely separate unfrequent army
chapter_105	furthermore concern these last mention leviathan -PRON- have two firm fortress which in all human probability will for ever remain impregnable
chapter_105	and as upon the invasion of -PRON- valley the frosty swiss have retreat to -PRON- mountain so hunt from the savanna and glade of the middle sea the whale bone whale can at last resort to -PRON- polar citadel and diving under the ultimate glassy barrier and wall there come up among icy field and floe and in a charmed circle of everlasting december bid defiance to all pursuit from man
chapter_105	natural as -PRON- be to be somewhat incredulous concern the populousness of the more enormous creature of the globe yet what shall -PRON- say to harto the historian of goa when -PRON- tell -PRON- that at one hunt the king of siam take 4,000 elephant that in those region elephant be numerous as drove of cattle in the temperate clime
chapter_105	moreover -PRON- be to consider that from the presume great longevity of whale -PRON- probably attain the age of a century and more therefore at any one period of time several distinct adult generation must be contemporary
chapter_105	and what that be -PRON- may soon gain some idea of by imagine all the grave yard cemetery and family vault of creation yield up the live body of all the man woman and child who be alive seventy five year ago and add this countless host to the present human population of the globe
chapter_105	wherefore for all these thing -PRON- account the whale immortal in -PRON- specie however perishable in -PRON- individuality
chapter_105	-PRON- swim the sea before the continent break water -PRON- once swim over the site of the tuileries and windsor castle and the kremlin
chapter_105	in noah 's flood -PRON- despise noah 's ark and if ever the world be to be again flood like the netherlands to kill off -PRON- rat then the eternal whale will still survive and rear upon the topmost crest of the equatorial flood spout -PRON- frothed defiance to the sky
chapter_106	the precipitate manner in which captain ahab have quit the samuel enderby of london have not be unattend with some small violence to -PRON- own person
chapter_106	-PRON- have light with such energy upon a thwart of -PRON- boat that -PRON- ivory leg have receive a half splinter shock
chapter_106	and when after gain -PRON- own deck and -PRON- own pivot hole there -PRON- so vehemently wheel round with an urgent command to the steersman -PRON- be as ever something about -PRON- not steer inflexibly enough then the already shake ivory receive such an additional twist and wrench that though -PRON- still remain entire and to all appearance lusty yet ahab do not deem -PRON- entirely trustworthy
chapter_106	and indeed -PRON- seem small matter for wonder that for all -PRON- pervade mad recklessness ahab do at time give careful heed to the condition of that dead bone upon which -PRON- partly stand
chapter_106	for -PRON- have not be very long prior to the pequod 's sailing from nantucket that -PRON- have be find one night lie prone upon the ground and insensible by some unknown and seemingly inexplicable unimaginable casualty -PRON- ivory limb have be so violently displace that -PRON- have stake wise smitten and all but pierce -PRON- groin nor be -PRON- without extreme difficulty that the agonizing wound be entirely cure
chapter_106	nor at the time have -PRON- fail to enter -PRON- monomaniac mind that all the anguish of that then present suffering be but the direct issue of a former woe and -PRON- too plainly seem to see that as the most poisonous reptile of the marsh perpetuate -PRON- kind as inevitably as the sweet songster of the grove so equally with every felicity all miserable event do naturally beget -PRON- like
chapter_106	yea more than equally think ahab since both the ancestry and posterity of grief go further than the ancestry and posterity of joy
chapter_106	for not to hint of this that -PRON- be an inference from certain canonic teaching that while some natural enjoyment here shall have no child bear to -PRON- for the other world but on the contrary shall be follow by the joy childlessness of all hell 's despair whereas some guilty mortal misery shall still fertilely beget to -PRON- an eternally progressive progeny of grief beyond the grave not at all to hint of this there still seem an inequality in the deep analysis of the thing
chapter_106	to trail the genealogy of these high mortal misery carry -PRON- at last among the sourceless primogeniture of the god so that in the face of all the glad hay make sun and soft cymballing round harvest moon -PRON- must need give in to this that the god -PRON- be not for ever glad
chapter_106	the ineffaceable sad birth mark in the brow of man be but the stamp of sorrow in the signer
chapter_106	with many other particular concern ahab always have -PRON- remain a mystery to some why -PRON- be that for a certain period both before and after the sailing of the pequod -PRON- have hide -PRON- away with such grand lama like exclusiveness and for that one interval seek speechless refuge as -PRON- be among the marble senate of the dead
chapter_106	captain peleg 's bruit reason for this thing appear by no means adequate though indeed as touch all ahab 's deep part every revelation partake more of significant darkness than of explanatory light
chapter_106	but in the end -PRON- all come out this one matter do at least
chapter_106	and not only this but to that ever contracting drop circle ashore who for any reason possess the privilege of a less ban approach to -PRON- to that timid circle the above hint casualty remain as -PRON- do moodily unaccounted for by ahab invest -PRON- with terror not entirely underived from the land of spirit and of wail
chapter_106	but be all this as -PRON- may let the unseen ambiguous synod in the air or the vindictive prince and potentate of fire have to do or not with earthly ahab yet in this present matter of -PRON- leg -PRON- take plain practical procedure -PRON- call the carpenter
chapter_107	the carpenter
chapter_107	seat thyself sultanically among the moon of saturn and take high abstracted man alone and -PRON- seem a wonder a grandeur and a woe
chapter_107	but from the same point take mankind in mass and for the most part -PRON- seem a mob of unnecessary duplicate both contemporary and hereditary
chapter_107	but besides the application to -PRON- of the generic remark above this carpenter of the pequod be singularly efficient in those thousand nameless mechanical emergency continually recur in a large ship upon a three or four year voyage in uncivilized and far distant sea
chapter_107	for not to speak of -PRON- readiness in ordinary duty repair stove boat sprung spar reform the shape of clumsy bladed oar insert bull 's eye in the deck or new tree nail in the side plank and other miscellaneous matter more directly pertain to -PRON- special business -PRON- be moreover unhesitatingly expert in all manner of conflicting aptitude both useful and capricious
chapter_107	at all time except when whale be alongside this bench be securely lash athwartship against the rear of the try work
chapter_107	a belaying pin be find too large to be easily insert into -PRON- hole the carpenter clap -PRON- into one of -PRON- ever ready vice and straightway file -PRON- small
chapter_107	a lose land bird of strange plumage stray on board and be make a captive out of clean shave rod of right whale bone and cross beam of sperm whale ivory the carpenter make a pagoda look cage for -PRON-
chapter_107	an oarsman sprain -PRON- wrist the carpenter concoct a soothe lotion
chapter_107	stubb long for vermillion star to be paint upon the blade of -PRON- every oar screw each oar in -PRON- big vice of wood the carpenter symmetrically supply the constellation
chapter_107	a sailor take a fancy to wear shark bone ear ring the carpenter drill -PRON- ear
chapter_107	another have the toothache the carpenter out pincer and clap one hand upon -PRON- bench bid -PRON- be seat there but the poor fellow unmanageably wince under the unconcluded operation whirl round the handle of -PRON- wooden vice the carpenter sign -PRON- to clap -PRON- jaw in that if -PRON- would have -PRON- draw the tooth
chapter_107	thus this carpenter be prepare at all point and alike indifferent and without respect in all
chapter_107	teeth -PRON- account bit of ivory head -PRON- deem but top block man -PRON- -PRON- lightly hold for capstan
chapter_107	but not precisely so
chapter_107	for nothing be this man more remarkable than for a certain impersonal stolidity as -PRON- be impersonal -PRON- say for -PRON- so shade off into the surround infinite of thing that -PRON- seem one with the general stolidity discernible in the whole visible world which while pauselessly active in uncounted mode still eternally hold -PRON- peace and ignore -PRON- though -PRON- dig foundation for cathedral
chapter_107	be -PRON- that this old carpenter have be a life long wanderer whose much rolling to and fro not only have gather no moss but what be more have rub off whatev small outward clinging may have originally pertain to -PRON-
chapter_107	-PRON- be a stript abstract an unfraction integral uncompromised as a new bear babe live without premeditated reference to this world or the next
chapter_107	-PRON- may almost say that this strange uncompromisedness in -PRON- involve a sort of unintelligence for in -PRON- numerous trade -PRON- do not seem to work so much by reason or by instinct or simply because -PRON- have be tutor to -PRON- or by any intermixture of all these even or uneven but merely by a kind of deaf and dumb spontaneous literal process
chapter_107	-PRON- be like one of those unreasoning but still highly useful multum in parvo sheffield contrivance assume the exterior
chapter_107	though a little swell of a common pocket knife but contain not only blade of various size but also screw driver cork screw tweezer awl pen ruler nail filer countersinker
chapter_107	so if -PRON- superior want to use the carpenter for a screw driver all -PRON- have to do be to open that part of -PRON- and the screw be fast or if for tweezer take -PRON- up by the leg and there -PRON- be
chapter_107	yet as previously hint this omnitool open and shut carpenter be after all no mere machine of an automaton
chapter_107	but there -PRON- be and there -PRON- have abide for now some sixty year or more
chapter_108	ahab and the carpenter

chapter_108	-PRON- do not wonder -PRON- look so scornful at -PRON-
chapter_108	-PRON- be a sort of strange thought sometimes -PRON- say but that be only haphazard like
chapter_108	then a short little old body like -PRON- should never undertake to wade out into deep water with tall heron build captain the water chuck -PRON- under the chin pretty quick and there be a great cry for life boat
chapter_108	and here be the heron 's leg

chapter_109	ahab and starbuck in the cabin
chapter_109	accord to usage -PRON- be pump the ship next morning and lo
chapter_109	no inconsiderable oil come up with the water the cask below must have spring a bad leak
chapter_109	much concern be show and starbuck go down into the cabin to report this unfavourable affair
chapter_109	
chapter_109	
chapter_109	in sperm whaleman with any considerable quantity of oil on board -PRON- be a regular semiweekly duty to conduct a hose into the hold and drench the cask with sea water which afterwards at vary interval be remove by the ship 's pump
chapter_109	hereby the cask be seek to be keep damply tight while by the change character of the withdrawn water the mariner readily detect any serious leakage in the precious cargo
chapter_109	now from the south and west the pequod be draw nigh to formosa and the bashee isles between which lie one of the tropical outlet from the china water into the pacific
chapter_109	and so starbuck find ahab with a general chart of the oriental archipelago spread before -PRON- and another separate one represent the long eastern coast of the japanese island niphon matsmai and sikoke
chapter_109	with -PRON- snow white new ivory leg brace against the screw leg of -PRON- table and with a long pruning hook of a jack knife in -PRON- hand the wondrous old man with -PRON- back to the gangway door be wrinkle -PRON- brow and trace -PRON- old course again

chapter_109	begone
chapter_109	captain ahab mistake -PRON- be i.
chapter_109	the oil in the hold be leak sir

chapter_109	either do that sir or waste in one day more oil than -PRON- may make good in a year
chapter_109	so -PRON- be so -PRON- be if -PRON- get -PRON-
chapter_109	-PRON- be speak of the oil in the hold sir
chapter_109	and -PRON- be not speak or thinking of that at all
chapter_109	-PRON- be all aleak -PRON-
chapter_109	yet -PRON- do not stop to plug -PRON- leak for who can find -PRON- in the deep load hull or how hope to plug -PRON- even if find in this life 's howl gale
chapter_109

chapter_109	owner owner
chapter_109	thou art always prate to -PRON- starbuck about those miserly owner as if the owner be -PRON- conscience
chapter_109	but look ye the only real owner of anything be -PRON- commander and hark ye -PRON- conscience be in this ship 's keel
chapter_109	on deck
chapter_109	captain ahab say the redden mate move further into the cabin with a daring so strangely respectful and cautious that -PRON- almost seem not only every way seek to avoid the slight outward manifestation of -PRON- but within also seem more than half distrustful of -PRON- a good man than -PRON- may well pass over in thee what -PRON- would quickly enough resent in a young man aye and in a happy captain ahab
chapter_109	devils
chapter_109	dost thou then so much as dare to critically think of -PRON-
chapter_109	on deck
chapter_109	nay sir not yet -PRON- do entreat
chapter_109	shall -PRON- not understand each other good than hitherto captain ahab
chapter_109	on deck
chapter_109	for an instant in the flash eye of the mate and -PRON- fiery cheek -PRON- would have almost think that -PRON- have really receive the blaze of the level tube
chapter_109	but master -PRON- emotion -PRON- half calmly rise and as -PRON- quit the cabin pause for an instant and say thou hast outraged not insult -PRON- sir but for that -PRON- ask thee not to beware of starbuck thou wouldst but laugh but let ahab beware of ahab beware of thyself old man
chapter_109	-PRON- wax brave but nevertheless obey most careful bravery that
chapter_109	murmur ahab as starbuck disappear
chapter_109	what be that -PRON- say ahab beware of ahab there be something there
chapter_109	
chapter_109	-PRON- be perhaps vain to surmise exactly why -PRON- be that as respect starbuck ahab thus act
chapter_109	-PRON- may have be a flash of honesty in -PRON- or mere prudential policy which under the circumstance imperiously forbid the slight symptom of open disaffection however transient in the important chief officer of -PRON- ship
chapter_109	however -PRON- be -PRON- order be execute and the burtons be hoist
chapter_110	so -PRON- be calm weather -PRON- break out deeper and deeper disturb the slumber of the huge ground tier butt and from that black midnight send those gigantic mole into the daylight above
chapter_110	so deep do -PRON- go and so ancient and corroded and weedy the aspect of the lowermost puncheon that -PRON- almost look next for some mouldy corner stone cask contain coin of captain noah with copy of the post placard vainly warn the infatuated old world from the flood
chapter_110	tierce after tierce too of water and bread and beef and shook of stave and iron bundle of hoop be hoist out till at last the piled deck be hard to get about and the hollow hull echo under foot as if -PRON- be tread over empty catacomb and reel and roll in the sea like an air freight demijohn
chapter_110	top heavy be the ship as a dinnerless student with all aristotle in -PRON- head
chapter_110	well be -PRON- that the typhoons do not visit -PRON- then
chapter_110	now at this time -PRON- be that -PRON- poor pagan companion and fast bosom friend queequeg be seize with a fever which bring -PRON- nigh to -PRON- endless end
chapter_110	be -PRON- say that in this vocation of whaling sinecure be unknown dignity and danger go hand in hand till -PRON- get to be captain the higher -PRON- rise the harder -PRON- toil
chapter_110	so with poor queequeg who as harpooneer must not only face all the rage of the live whale but as -PRON- have elsewhere see mount -PRON- dead back in a rolling sea and finally descend into the gloom of the hold and bitterly sweat all day in that subterraneous confinement resolutely manhandle the clumsy cask and see to -PRON- stowage
chapter_110	to be short among whaleman the harpooneer be the holder so call poor queequeg
chapter_110	when the ship be about half disembowel -PRON- should have stoop over the hatchway and peer down upon -PRON- there where strip to -PRON- woollen drawer the tattooed savage be crawl about amid that dampness and slime like a green spotted lizard at the bottom of a well
chapter_110	and a well or an ice house -PRON- somehow prove to -PRON- poor pagan where strange to say for all the heat of -PRON- sweating -PRON- catch a terrible chill which lapse into a fever and at last after some day suffering lay -PRON- in -PRON- hammock close to the very sill of the door of death
chapter_110	how -PRON- waste and waste away in those few long linger day till there seem but little left of -PRON- but -PRON- frame and tattooing
chapter_110	but as all else in -PRON- thin and -PRON- cheek bone grow sharp -PRON- eye nevertheless seem grow full and full -PRON- become of a strange softness of lustre and mildly but deeply look out at -PRON- there from -PRON- sickness a wondrous testimony to that immortal health in -PRON- which could not die or be weaken
chapter_110	and like circle on the water which as -PRON- grow faint expand so -PRON- eye seem rounding and rounding like the ring of eternity
chapter_110	an awe that can not be name would steal over -PRON- as -PRON- sit by the side of this wan savage and see as strange thing in -PRON- face as any beheld who be bystander when zoroaster die
chapter_110	for whatev be truly wondrous and fearful in man never yet be put into word or book
chapter_110	so that let -PRON- say -PRON- again no die chaldee or greek have high and holy thought than those whose mysterious shade -PRON- see creep over the face of poor queequeg as -PRON- quietly lie in -PRON- sway hammock and the rolling sea seem gently rock -PRON- to -PRON- final rest and the ocean 's invisible flood tide lift -PRON- high and high towards -PRON- destine heaven
chapter_110	not a man of the crew but give -PRON- up and as for queequeg -PRON- what -PRON- think of -PRON- case be forcibly show by a curious favour -PRON- ask
chapter_110	-PRON- call one to -PRON- in the grey morning watch when the day be just break and take -PRON- hand say that while in nantucket -PRON- have chance to see certain little canoe of dark wood like the rich war wood of -PRON- native isle and upon inquiry -PRON- have learn that all whaleman who die in nantucket be lay in those same dark canoe and that the fancy of be so lay have much please -PRON- for -PRON- be not unlike the custom of -PRON- own race who after embalm a dead warrior stretch -PRON- out in -PRON- canoe and so leave -PRON- to be float away to the starry archipelago for not only do -PRON- believe that the star be isle but that far beyond all visible horizon -PRON- own mild uncontinented sea interflow with the blue heavens and so form the white breaker of the milky way
chapter_110	there be some heathenish coffin coloured old lumber aboard which upon a long previous voyage have be cut from the aboriginal grove of the lackaday island and from these dark plank the coffin be recommend to be make
chapter_110	no sooner be the carpenter apprise of the order than take -PRON- rule -PRON- forthwith with all the indifferent promptitude of -PRON- character proceed into the forecastle and take queequeg 's measure with great accuracy regularly chalk queequeg 's person as -PRON- shift the rule
chapter_110	ah poor fellow
chapter_110	-PRON- will have to die now ejaculate the long island sailor
chapter_110	this do -PRON- marshal the plank and -PRON- tool and to work
chapter_110	when the last nail be drive and the lid duly plan and fit -PRON- lightly shoulder the coffin and go forward with -PRON- inquire whether -PRON- be ready for -PRON- yet in that direction
chapter_110	overhear the indignant but half humorous cry with which the people on deck begin to drive the coffin away queequeg to every one 's consternation command that the thing should be instantly bring to -PRON- nor be there any deny -PRON- see that of all mortal some die man be the most tyrannical and certainly since -PRON- will shortly trouble -PRON- so little for evermore the poor fellow ought to be indulge
chapter_110	lean over in -PRON- hammock queequeg long regard the coffin with an attentive eye
chapter_110	-PRON- then call for -PRON- harpoon have the wooden stock draw from -PRON- and then have the iron part place in the coffin along with one of the paddle of -PRON- boat

chapter_110	now queequeg die and -PRON- will beat ye -PRON- dying march
chapter_110	-PRON- have hear murmur starbuck gaze down the scuttle that in violent fever man all ignorance have talk in ancient tongue and that when the mystery be probe -PRON- turn out always that in -PRON- wholly forget childhood those ancient tongue have be really speak in -PRON- hearing by some lofty scholar
chapter_110	where learn -PRON- that but there
chapter_110	hark
chapter_110	-PRON- speak again but more wildly now
chapter_110	form two and two
chapter_110	let -PRON- make a general of -PRON-

chapter_110	pip be lead away and the sick man be replace in -PRON- hammock
chapter_110	but now that -PRON- have apparently make every preparation for death now that -PRON- coffin be prove a good fit queequeg suddenly rally soon there seem no need of the carpenter 's box and thereupon when some express -PRON- delighted surprise -PRON- in substance say that the because of -PRON- sudden convalescence be this at a critical moment -PRON- have just recall a little duty ashore which -PRON- be leave undo and therefore have change -PRON- mind about die -PRON- could not die yet -PRON- aver
chapter_110	-PRON- ask -PRON- then whether to live or die be a matter of -PRON- own sovereign will and pleasure
chapter_110	-PRON- answer certainly
chapter_110	in a word -PRON- be queequeg 's conceit that if a man make up -PRON- mind to live mere sickness could not kill -PRON- nothing but a whale or a gale or some violent ungovernable unintelligent destroyer of that sort
chapter_110	now there be this noteworthy difference between savage and civilized that while a sick civilized man may be six month convalesce generally speak a sick savage be almost half well again in a day
chapter_110	so in good time -PRON- queequeg gain strength and at length after sit on the windlass for a few indolent day but eat with a vigorous appetite -PRON- suddenly leap to -PRON- foot throw out -PRON- arm and leg give -PRON- a good stretching yawn a little bit and then spring into the head of -PRON- hoist boat and poise a harpoon pronounce -PRON- fit for a fight

chapter_110	and this tattooing have be the work of a departed prophet and seer of -PRON- island who by those hieroglyphic mark have write out on -PRON- body a complete theory of the heaven and the earth and a mystical treatise on the art of attain truth so that queequeg in -PRON- own proper person be a riddle to unfold a wondrous work in one volume but whose mystery not even -PRON- could read though -PRON- own live heart beat against -PRON- and these mystery be therefore destine in the end to moulder away with the living parchment whereon -PRON- be inscribe and so be unsolved to the last
chapter_110	"and this think -PRON- must have be which suggest to ahab that wild exclamation of -PRON- when one morning turn away from surveying poor queequeg--""oh devilish tantalization of the god"

chapter_124	the sea be as a crucible of molten gold that bubblingly leap with light and heat long maintain an enchanted silence ahab stand apart and every time the teter ship loweringly pitch down -PRON- bowsprit -PRON- turn to eye the bright sun 's ray produce ahead and when -PRON- profoundly settle by the stern -PRON- turn behind and see the sun 's rearward place and how the same yellow ray be blend with -PRON- undeviating wake
chapter_124	all ye nation before -PRON- prow -PRON- bring the sun to ye
chapter_124	yoke on the further billow hallo a tandem -PRON- drive the sea
chapter_124	east sou east sir say the frightened steersman
chapter_124	thou liest
chapter_124	smite -PRON- with -PRON- clenched fist
chapter_124	head east at this hour in the morning and the sun astern
chapter_124	stand behind -PRON- starbuck look and lo
chapter_124	the two compass point east and the pequod be as infallibly go west
chapter_124	mr. starbuck last night 's thunder turn -PRON- compass that be all
chapter_124	aye
chapter_124	but never before have -PRON- happen to -PRON- sir say the pale mate gloomily
chapter_124	here -PRON- must needs be say that accident like this have in more than one case occur to ship in violent storm
chapter_124	the magnetic energy as develop in the mariner 's needle be as all know essentially one with the electricity behold in heaven hence -PRON- be not to be much marvel at that such thing should be
chapter_124	instance where the lightning have actually strike the vessel so as to smite down some of the spar and rigging the effect upon the needle have at time be still more fatal all -PRON- loadstone virtue be annihilate so that the before magnetic steel be of no more use than an old wife 's knitting needle
chapter_124	but in either case the needle never again of -PRON- recover the original virtue thus mar or lose and if the binnacle compass be affect the same fate reach all the other that may be in the ship even be the lowermost one insert into the kelson
chapter_124	deliberately stand before the binnacle and eye the transpointed compass the old man with the sharp of -PRON- extended hand now take the precise bearing of the sun and satisfy that the needle be exactly invert shout out -PRON- order for the ship 's course to be change accordingly
chapter_124	meanwhile whatev be -PRON- own secret thought starbuck say nothing but quietly -PRON- issue all requisite order while stubb and flask who in some small degree seem then to be share -PRON- feeling likewise unmurmuringly acquiesce
chapter_124	as for the man though some of -PRON- lowly rumble -PRON- fear of ahab be great than -PRON- fear of fate
chapter_124	but as ever before the pagan harpooneer remain almost wholly unimpressed or if impressed -PRON- be only with a certain magnetism shoot into -PRON- congenial heart from inflexible
chapter_124	but chancing to slip with -PRON- ivory heel -PRON- see the crushed copper sight tube of the quadrant -PRON- have the day before dash to the deck
chapter_124	thou poor proud heaven gazer and sun 's pilot
chapter_124	yesterday -PRON- wreck thee and to day the compass would fain have wreck -PRON-
chapter_124	but ahab be lord over the level loadstone yet
chapter_124	mr. starbuck a lance without a pole a top maul and the small of the sail maker 's needle
chapter_124	accessory perhaps to the impulse dictate the thing -PRON- be now about to do be certain prudential motif whose object may have be to revive the spirit of -PRON- crew by a stroke of -PRON- subtile skill in a matter so wondrous as that of the inverted compass
chapter_124	besides the old man well know that to steer by transpoint needle though clumsily practicable be not a thing to be pass over by superstitious sailor without some shuddering and evil portent
chapter_124	man say -PRON- steadily turn upon the crew as the mate hand -PRON- the thing -PRON- have demand -PRON- man the thunder turn old ahab 's needle but out of this bit of steel ahab can make one of -PRON- own that will point as true as any
chapter_124	
chapter_124	abashed glance of servile wonder be exchange by the sailor as this be say and with fascinated eye -PRON- await whatev magic may follow
chapter_124	but starbuck look away
chapter_124	with a blow from the top maul ahab knock off the steel head of the lance and then hand to the mate the long iron rod remain bade -PRON- hold -PRON- upright without -PRON- touch the deck
chapter_124	then with the maul after repeatedly smite the upper end of this iron rod -PRON- place the blunt needle endwise on the top of -PRON- and less strongly hammer that several time the mate still hold the rod as before
chapter_124	"at first the steel go round and round quiver and vibrate at either end but at last -PRON- settle to -PRON- place when ahab who have be intently watch for this result step frankly back from the binnacle and point -PRON- stretched arm towards -PRON- exclaimed,--""look ye for yourself if ahab be not lord of the level loadstone"
chapter_124	the sun be east and that compass swear -PRON-
chapter_124	one after another -PRON- peer in for nothing but -PRON- own eye could persuade such ignorance as -PRON- and one after another -PRON- slink away
chapter_124	in -PRON- fiery eye of scorn and triumph -PRON- then see ahab in all -PRON- fatal pride
chapter_125	the log and line
chapter_125	while now the fated pequod have be so long afloat this voyage the log and line have but very seldom be in use
chapter_125	owe to a confident reliance upon other mean of determine the vessel 's place some merchantman and many whaleman especially when cruise wholly neglect to heave the log though at the same time and frequently more for form 's sake than anything else regularly put down upon the customary slate the course steer by the ship as well as the presumed average rate of progression every hour
chapter_125	the wooden reel and angular log attach hung long untouched just beneath the railing of the after bulwark
chapter_125	rain and spray have damp -PRON- sun and wind have warp -PRON- all the element have combine to rot a thing that hang so idly
chapter_125	the ship be sailing plungingly astern the billow roll in riot forward there
chapter_125	heave the log
chapter_125	the golden hued tahitian and the grizzly manxman
chapter_125	take the reel one of ye -PRON- will heave
chapter_125	-PRON- go towards the extreme stern on the ship 's lee side where the deck with the oblique energy of the wind be now almost dip into the creamy sidelong rush sea
chapter_125	the manxman take the reel and hold -PRON- high up by the project handle end of the spindle round which the spool of line revolve so stand with the angular log hang downwards till ahab advance to -PRON-
chapter_125	sir -PRON- mistrust -PRON- this line look far go long heat and wet have spoiled -PRON-
chapter_125	twill hold old gentleman
chapter_125	thou seem'st to hold
chapter_125	or truer perhaps life hold thee not thou -PRON-
chapter_125	
chapter_125	-PRON- hold the spool sir
chapter_125	but just as -PRON- captain say
chapter_125	with these grey hair of mine tis not worth while dispute specially with a superior who will ne'er confess
chapter_125	
chapter_125	what be that
chapter_125	there now be a patch professor in queen nature 's granite found college but methink -PRON- be too subservient

chapter_125	-PRON- know not sir but -PRON- be bear there
chapter_125	
chapter_125	in the isle of man hey
chapter_125	well the other way -PRON- be good
chapter_125	here be a man from man a man bear in once independent man and now unmanned of man which be suck in by what
chapter_125	up with the reel
chapter_125	the dead blind wall butt all inquire head at last
chapter_125	up with -PRON-
chapter_125	so
chapter_125	the loose coil rapidly straighten out in a long drag line astern and then instantly the reel begin to whirl
chapter_125	in turn jerkingly raise and lower by the roll billow the tow resistance of the log cause the old reelman to stagger strangely
chapter_125	-PRON- crush the quadrant the thunder turn the needle and now the mad sea part the log line
chapter_125	but ahab can mend all
chapter_125	and look ye let the carpenter make another log and mend thou the line
chapter_125	there -PRON- go now to -PRON- nothing be happen but to -PRON- the skewer seem loosen out of the middle of the world
chapter_125	haul in haul in tahitian
chapter_125	these line run whole and whirl out come in broken and drag slow
chapter_125	come to help eh pip

chapter_125	that man should be a thing for immortal soul to sieve through
chapter_125	who art thou boy
chapter_125	bell boy sir ship's crier ding dong ding

chapter_125	there can be no heart above the snow line
chapter_125	oh ye frozen heaven
chapter_125	look down here

chapter_125	here boy ahab 's cabin shall be pip 's home henceforth while ahab live
chapter_125	thou touch -PRON- inmost centre boy thou art tie to -PRON- by cord weave of -PRON- heart string
chapter_125	here be velvet shark skin intently gaze at ahab 's hand and feel -PRON-
chapter_125	ah now have poor pip but feel so kind a thing as this perhaps -PRON- have ne'er be lose
chapter_125	this seem to -PRON- sir as a man rope something that weak soul may hold by
chapter_125	oh sir let old perth now come and rivet these two hand together the black one with the white for -PRON- will not let this go
chapter_125	
chapter_125	oh boy nor will -PRON- thee unless -PRON- should thereby drag thee to bad horror than be here
chapter_125	come then to -PRON- cabin
chapter_125	lo
chapter_125	see the omniscient god oblivious of suffer man and man though idiotic and know not what -PRON- do yet full of the sweet thing of love and gratitude
chapter_125	come
chapter_125	there go two daft one now mutter the old manxman
chapter_125	one daft with strength the other daft with weakness
chapter_125	but here be the end of the rotten line all dripping too
chapter_125	mend -PRON- eh
chapter_125	-PRON- think -PRON- have good have a new line altogether
chapter_126	the life buoy steering now south eastward by ahab 's level steel and -PRON- progress solely determine by ahab 's level log and line the pequod hold on -PRON- path towards the equator
chapter_126	make so long a passage through such unfrequented water descry no ship and ere long sideways impel by unvary trade wind over wave monotonously mild all these seem the strange calm thing prelude some riotous and desperate scene
chapter_126	yet the grey manxman the old mariner of all declare that the wild thrilling sound that be hear be the voice of newly drown man in the sea
chapter_126	-PRON- hollowly laugh and thus explain the wonder
chapter_126	those rocky island the ship have pass be the resort of great number of seal and some young seal that have lose -PRON- dam or some dam that have lose -PRON- cub must have rise nigh the ship and keep company with -PRON- cry and sob with -PRON- human sort of wail
chapter_126	but this only the more affected some of -PRON- because most mariner cherish a very superstitious feeling about seal arise not only from -PRON- peculiar tone when in distress but also from the human look of -PRON- round head and semi intelligent face see peeringly uprising from the water alongside
chapter_126	but the boding of the crew be destine to receive a most plausible confirmation in the fate of one of -PRON- number that morning
chapter_126	at sun rise this man go from -PRON- hammock to -PRON- mast head at the fore and whether -PRON- be that -PRON- be not yet half wake from -PRON- sleep for sailor sometimes go aloft in a transition state whether -PRON- be thus with the man there be now no telling but be that as -PRON- may -PRON- have not be long at -PRON- perch when a cry be hear a cry and a rushing and look up -PRON- see a fall phantom in the air and look down a little toss heap of white bubble in the blue of the sea
chapter_126	and thus the first man of the pequod that mount the mast to look out for the white whale on the white whale 's own peculiar ground that man be swallow up in the deep
chapter_126	but few perhaps think of that at the time
chapter_126	indeed in some sort -PRON- be not grieve at this event at least as a portent for -PRON- regard -PRON- not as a foreshadowing of evil in the future but as the fulfilment of an evil already presage
chapter_126	-PRON- declare that now -PRON- know the reason of those wild shriek -PRON- have hear the night before
chapter_126	but again the old manxman say nay
chapter_126	the lose life buoy be now to be replace starbuck be direct to see to -PRON- but as no cask of sufficient lightness could be find and as in the feverish eagerness of what seem the approach crisis of the voyage all hand be impatient of any toil but what be directly connect with -PRON- final end whatev that may prove to be therefore -PRON- be go to leave the ship 's stern unprovided with a buoy when by certain strange sign and inuendo
chapter_126	queequeg hint a hint concern -PRON- coffin
chapter_126	a life buoy of a coffin cry starbuck start
chapter_126	-PRON- will make a good enough one say flask the carpenter here can arrange -PRON- easily
chapter_126	bring -PRON- up there be nothing else for -PRON- say starbuck after a melancholy pause
chapter_126	rig -PRON-
chapter_126	and shall -PRON- nail down the lid sir
chapter_126	move -PRON- hand as with a hammer
chapter_126	and shall -PRON- caulk the seam sir
chapter_126	move -PRON- hand as with a caulking iron aye and shall -PRON- then pay over the same with pitch sir
chapter_126	move -PRON- hand as with a pitch pot away what possess thee to this
chapter_126	make a life buoy of the coffin and no more
chapter_126	mr
chapter_126	stubb mr. flask come forward with -PRON-
chapter_126	
chapter_126	-PRON- go off in a huff
chapter_126	now -PRON- do not like this
chapter_126	be all -PRON- pain to go for nothing with that coffin
chapter_126	-PRON- be like turn an old coat go to bring the flesh on the other side now
chapter_126	-PRON- do not like this cobble sort of business -PRON- do not like -PRON- at all -PRON- be undignified -PRON- be not -PRON- place
chapter_126	-PRON- like to take in hand none but clean virgin fair and square mathematical job something that regularly begin at the beginning and be at the middle when midway and come to an end at the conclusion not a cobbler 's job that be at an end in the middle and at the beginning at the end
chapter_126	-PRON- be the old woman 's trick to be give cobble job
chapter_126	what an affection all old woman have for tinker
chapter_126	but heigh ho
chapter_126	there be no cap at sea but snow cap
chapter_126	let -PRON- see
chapter_126	some superstitious old carpenter now would be tie up in the rigging ere -PRON- would do the job
chapter_126	cruppered with a coffin
chapter_126	but never mind
chapter_126	-PRON- worker in wood make bridal bedstead and card table as well as coffin and hearse
chapter_126	hem
chapter_126	-PRON- will have -PRON- let 's see how many in the ship 's company all tell
chapter_126	any way -PRON- will have -PRON- thirty separate turk's head life line each three foot long hang all round to the coffin
chapter_126	then if the hull go down there will be thirty lively fellow all fight for one coffin a sight not see very often beneath the sun
chapter_126	let -PRON- to -PRON-

chapter_128	but ere -PRON- commander who with trumpet to mouth stand up in -PRON- boat ere -PRON- could hopefully hail ahab 's voice be hear
chapter_128	hast see the white whale
chapter_128	
chapter_128	aye yesterday
chapter_128	have ye see a whale boat adrift
chapter_128	a few keen pull and -PRON- boat hook soon clinch the pequod 's main chain and -PRON- spring to the deck
chapter_128	immediately -PRON- be recognise by ahab for a nantucketer -PRON- know
chapter_128	but no formal salutation be exchange
chapter_128	where be -PRON- not killed!--not kill
chapter_128	how be -PRON-
chapter_128	-PRON- seem that somewhat late on the afternoon of the day previous while three of the stranger 's boat be engage with a shoal of whale which have lead -PRON- some four or five mile from the ship and while -PRON- be yet in swift chase to windward the white hump and head of moby dick have suddenly loom up out of the water not very far to leeward whereupon the fourth rig boat a reserved one have be instantly lower in chase
chapter_128	after a keen sail before the wind this fourth boat the swiftest keel of all seem to have succeed in fasten at least as well as the man at the mast head could tell anything about -PRON-
chapter_128	the recall signal be place in the rigging darkness come on and force to pick up -PRON- three far to windward boat ere go in quest of the fourth one in the precisely opposite direction the ship have not only be necessitate to leave that boat to -PRON- fate till near midnight but for the time to increase -PRON- distance from -PRON-
chapter_128	but the rest of -PRON- crew be at last safe aboard -PRON- crowd all sail stunsail on stunsail after the miss boat kindle a fire in -PRON- try pot for a beacon and every other man aloft on the look out
chapter_128	but though when -PRON- have thus sail a sufficient distance to gain the presume place of the absent one when last see though -PRON- then pause to lower -PRON- spare boat to pull all around -PRON- and not find anything have again dash on again pause and lower -PRON- boat and though -PRON- have thus continue do till daylight yet not the least glimpse of the missing keel have be see
chapter_128	the story tell the stranger captain immediately go on to reveal -PRON- object in board the pequod
chapter_128	-PRON- will wager something now whisper stubb to flask that some one in that miss boat wear off that captain 's good coat mayhap -PRON- watch -PRON- be so curse anxious to get -PRON- back
chapter_128	who ever hear of two pious whale ship cruise after one miss whale boat in the height of the whaling season
chapter_128	see flask only see how pale -PRON- look pale in the very button of -PRON- eye look -PRON- be not the coat -PRON- must have be the--
chapter_128	-PRON- boy -PRON- own boy be among -PRON-
chapter_128	for eight and forty hour let -PRON- charter -PRON- ship -PRON- will gladly pay for -PRON- and roundly pay for -PRON- if there be no other way for eight and forty hour only only that -PRON- must oh -PRON- must and -PRON- shall do this thing

chapter_128	-PRON- take back the coat and watch what say ahab
chapter_128	-PRON- must save that boy
chapter_128	
chapter_128	but the captain for some unknown constitutional reason have refrain from mention all this and not till force to -PRON- by ahab 's iciness do -PRON- allude to -PRON- one yet miss boy a little lad but twelve year old whose father with the earnest but unmisgiv hardihood of a nantucketer 's paternal love have thus early seek to initiate -PRON- in the peril and wonder of a vocation almost immemorially the destiny of all -PRON- race
chapter_128	nor do -PRON- unfrequently occur that nantucket captain will send a son of such tender age away from -PRON- for a protract three or four year voyage in some other ship than -PRON- own so that -PRON- first knowledge of a whaleman 's career shall be unenervat by any chance display of a father 's natural but untimely partiality or undue apprehensiveness and concern
chapter_128	meantime now the stranger be still beseech -PRON- poor boon of ahab and ahab still stand like an anvil receive every shock but without the least quiver of -PRON- own
chapter_128	-PRON- will not go say the stranger till -PRON- say aye to -PRON-

chapter_128	but start from -PRON- enchantment gardiner silently hurry to the side more fall than step into -PRON- boat and return to -PRON- ship
chapter_128	soon the two ship diverge -PRON- wake and long as the strange vessel be in view -PRON- be see to yaw hither and thither at every dark spot however small on the sea
chapter_128	but by -PRON- still halt course and wind woeful way -PRON- plainly see that this ship that so weep with spray still remain without comfort

chapter_130	the hat
chapter_130	and now that at the proper time and place after so long and wide a preliminary cruise ahab all other whaling water sweep seem to have chase -PRON- foe into an ocean fold to slay -PRON- the more securely there now that -PRON- find -PRON- hard by the very latitude and longitude where -PRON- tormenting wound have be inflict now that a vessel have be speak which on the very day precede have actually encounter moby dick and now that all -PRON- successive meeting with various ship contrastingly concur to show the demoniac indifference with which the white whale tear -PRON- hunter whether sin or sin against now -PRON- be that there lurk a something in the old man 's eye which -PRON- be hardly sufferable for feeble soul to see
chapter_130	as the unsett polar star which through the livelong arctic six month night sustain -PRON- piercing steady central gaze so ahab 's purpose now fixedly gleam down upon the constant midnight of the gloomy crew
chapter_130	-PRON- domineer above -PRON- so that all -PRON- boding doubt misgiving fear be fain to hide beneath -PRON- soul and not sprout forth a single spear or leaf
chapter_130	in this foreshadowing interval too all humor force or natural vanish
chapter_130	stubb no more strove to raise a smile starbuck no more strove to check one
chapter_130	alike joy and sorrow hope and fear seem ground to fine dust and powdered for the time in the clamped mortar of ahab 's iron soul
chapter_130	like machine -PRON- dumbly move about the deck ever conscious that the old man 's despot eye be on -PRON-
chapter_130	but do -PRON- deeply scan -PRON- in -PRON- more secret confidential hour when -PRON- think no glance but one be on -PRON- then -PRON- would have see that even as ahab 's eye so awe the crew 's the inscrutable parsee 's glance awe -PRON- or somehow at least in some wild way at time affect -PRON-
chapter_130	such an add glide strangeness begin to invest the thin fedallah now such ceaseless shuddering shake -PRON- that the man look dubious at -PRON- half uncertain as -PRON- seem whether indeed -PRON- be a mortal substance or else a tremulous shadow cast upon the deck by some unseen being 's body
chapter_130	for not by night even have fedallah ever certainly be know to slumber or go below
chapter_130	-PRON- would stand still for hour but never sit or lean -PRON- wan but wondrous eye do plainly say -PRON- two watchman never rest
chapter_130	nor at any time by night or day could the mariner now step upon the deck unless ahab be before -PRON- either stand in -PRON- pivot hole or exactly pace the plank between two undeviating limit the main mast and the mizen or else -PRON- see -PRON- stand in the cabin scuttle -PRON- living foot advanced upon the deck as if to step -PRON- hat slouch heavily over -PRON- eye so that however motionless -PRON- stand however the day and night be add on that -PRON- have not swing in -PRON- hammock yet hide beneath that slouching hat -PRON- could never tell unerringly whether for all this -PRON- eye be really close at time or whether -PRON- be still intently scan -PRON- no matter though -PRON- stand so in the scuttle for a whole hour on the stretch and the unheeded night damp gather in bead of dew upon that stone carve coat and hat
chapter_130	the clothe that the night have wet the next day 's sunshine dry upon -PRON- and so day after day and night after night
chapter_130	but though -PRON- whole life be now become one watch on deck and though the parsee 's mystic watch be without intermission as -PRON- own yet these two never seem to speak one man to the other unless at long interval some pass unmomentous matter make -PRON- necessary
chapter_130	if by day -PRON- chance to speak one word by night dumb man be both so far as concern the slight verbal interchange
chapter_130	at time for long hour without a single hail -PRON- stand far part in the starlight ahab in -PRON- scuttle the parsee by the mainmast but still fixedly gaze upon each other as if in the parsee ahab see -PRON- forethrown shadow in ahab the parsee -PRON- abandon substance
chapter_130	for be this parsee what -PRON- may all rib and keel be solid ahab
chapter_130	"at the first faint glimmering of the dawn -PRON- iron voice be hear from aft,--""man the mast heads!""--and all through the day till after sunset and after twilight the same voice every hour at the striking of the helmsman 's bell be heard--""what d'ye see sharp sharp"
chapter_130	but if these suspicion be really -PRON- -PRON- sagaciously refrain from verbally express -PRON- however -PRON- action may seem to hint -PRON-
chapter_130	-PRON- will have the first sight of the whale -PRON- -PRON- say
chapter_130	"this do with that end yet in -PRON- hand and standing beside the pin -PRON- look round upon -PRON- crew sweep from one to the other pause -PRON- glance long upon daggoo queequeg tashtego but shun fedallah and then settle -PRON- firm rely eye upon the chief mate said,--""take the rope sir -PRON- give -PRON- into thy hand starbuck"
chapter_130	then arrange -PRON- person in the basket -PRON- give the word for -PRON- to hoist -PRON- to -PRON- perch starbuck be the one who secure the rope at last and afterwards stand near -PRON-
chapter_130	and thus with one hand cling round the royal mast ahab gaze abroad upon the sea for mile and mile ahead astern this side and that within the wide expand circle command at so great a height
chapter_130	when in work with -PRON- hand at some lofty almost isolated place in the rigging which chance to afford no foothold the sailor at sea be hoist up to that spot and sustain there by the rope under these circumstance -PRON- fastened end on deck be always give in strict charge to some one man who have the special watch of -PRON-
chapter_130	because in such a wilderness of run rigging whose various different relation aloft can not always be infallibly discern by what be see of -PRON- at the deck and when the deck end of these rope be be every few minute cast down from the fastening -PRON- would be but a natural fatality if unprovid with a constant watchman the hoist sailor should by some carelessness of the crew be cast adrift and fall all swoop to the sea
chapter_130	so ahab 's proceeding in this matter be not unusual the only strange thing about -PRON- seem to be that starbuck almost the one only man who have ever venture to oppose -PRON- with anything in the slight degree approach to decision one of those too whose faithfulness on the look out -PRON- have seem to doubt somewhat -PRON- be strange that this be the very man -PRON- should select for -PRON- watchman freely give -PRON- whole life into such an otherwise distrust person 's hand
chapter_130	now the first time ahab be perch aloft ere -PRON- have be there ten minute one of those red bill savage sea hawk which so often fly incommodiously close round the manned mast head of whaleman in these latitude one of these bird come wheel and scream round -PRON- head in a maze of untrackably swift circling
chapter_130	then -PRON- dart a thousand foot straight up into the air then spiraliz downwards and go eddy again round -PRON- head
chapter_130	but with -PRON- gaze fix upon the dim and distant horizon ahab seem not to mark this wild bird nor indeed would any one else have mark -PRON- much -PRON- be no uncommon circumstance only now almost the least heedful eye seem to see some sort of cunning meaning in almost every sight
chapter_130	an eagle fly thrice round tarquin 's head remove -PRON- cap to replace -PRON- and thereupon tanaquil -PRON- wife declare that tarquin would be king of rome
chapter_130	but only by the replacing of the cap be that omen account good
chapter_130	ahab 's hat be never restore the wild hawk fly on and on with -PRON- far in advance of the prow and at last disappear while from the point of that disappearance a minute black spot be dimly discern fall from that vast height into the sea

chapter_132	hither and thither on high glide the snow white wing of small unspeckled bird these be the gentle thought of the feminine air but to and fro in the deep far down in the bottomless blue rush mighty leviathan sword fish and shark and these be the strong troubled murderous thinking of the masculine sea
chapter_132	but though thus contrast within the contrast be only in shade and shadow without those two seem one -PRON- be only the sex as -PRON- be that distinguish -PRON-
chapter_132	aloft like a royal czar and king the sun seem give this gentle air to this bold and rolling sea even as bride to groom

chapter_132	slowly cross the deck from the scuttle ahab lean over the side and watch how -PRON- shadow in the water sink and sink to -PRON- gaze the more and the more that -PRON- strive to pierce the profundity
chapter_132	but the lovely aroma in that enchant air do at last seem to dispel for a moment the cankerous thing in -PRON- soul
chapter_132	that glad happy air that winsome sky do at last stroke and caress -PRON- the step mother world so long cruel forbidding now throw affectionate arm round -PRON- stubborn neck and do seem to joyously sob over -PRON- as if over one that however wilful and err -PRON- could yet find -PRON- in -PRON- heart to save and to bless

chapter_132	fedallah be motionlessly lean over the same rail
chapter_133	the chase first day
chapter_133	the acute policy dictate these movement be sufficiently vindicate at daybreak by the sight of a long sleek on the sea directly and lengthwise ahead smooth as oil and resemble in the pleated watery wrinkle border -PRON- the polished metallic like mark of some swift tide rip at the mouth of a deep rapid stream man the mast head

chapter_133	from this height the whale be now see some mile or so ahead at every roll of the sea reveal -PRON- high sparkling hump and regularly jet -PRON- silent spout into the air
chapter_133	to the credulous mariner -PRON- seem the same silent spout -PRON- have so long ago behold in the moonlit atlantic and indian oceans

chapter_133	-PRON- cry in long draw linger methodic tone attuned to the gradual prolonging of the whale 's visible jet
chapter_133	down top gallant sail

chapter_133	-PRON- be head straight to leeward sir cry stubb right away from -PRON- can not have see the ship yet
chapter_133	
chapter_133	stand by the brace
chapter_133	hard down the helm!--brace up
chapter_133	shiver her!--shiver her!--so well that
chapter_133	a pale death glimmer light up fedallah 's sunken eye a hideous motion gnaw -PRON- mouth
chapter_133	at length the breathless hunter come so nigh
chapter_133	-PRON- seemingly unsuspecting prey that -PRON- entire dazzling hump be distinctly visible slide along the sea as if an isolated thing and continually set in a revolving ring of fine fleecy greenish foam
chapter_133	-PRON- see the vast involve wrinkle of the slightly project head beyond
chapter_133	before -PRON- far out on the soft turkish rugged water go the glisten white shadow from -PRON- broad milky forehead a musical ripple playfully accompany the shade and behind the blue water interchangeably flow over into the move valley of -PRON- steady wake and on either hand bright bubble arise and dance by -PRON- side
chapter_133	but these be break again by the light toe of hundred of gay fowl softly feather the sea alternate with -PRON- fitful flight and like to some flag staff rise from the paint hull of an argosy the tall but shattered pole of a recent lance project from the white whale 's back and at interval one of the cloud of soft toed fowl hover and to and fro skim like a canopy over the fish silently perch and rocked on this pole the long tail feather stream like pennon
chapter_133	on each soft side coincident with the part swell that but once leave -PRON- then flow so wide away on each bright side the whale shed off enticing
chapter_133	no wonder there have be some among the hunter who namelessly transport and allure by all this serenity have venture to assail -PRON- but have fatally find that quietude but the vesture of tornado
chapter_133	yet calm entice calm oh whale thou glidest on to all who for the first time eye thee no matter how many in that same way thou may'st have bejuggl and destroy before
chapter_133	and thus through the serene tranquillity of the tropical sea among wave whose hand clapping be suspend by exceed rapture
chapter_133	with oar apeak and paddle down the sheet of -PRON- sail adrift the three boat now stilly float await moby dick 's reappearance
chapter_133	an hour say ahab stand root in -PRON- boat 's stern and -PRON- gaze beyond the whale 's place towards the dim blue space and wide woo vacancy to leeward
chapter_133	-PRON- be only an instant for again -PRON- eye seem whirl round in -PRON- head as -PRON- sweep the watery circle
chapter_133	the birds!--the bird cry
chapter_133	but suddenly as -PRON- peer down and down into -PRON- depth -PRON- profoundly see a white living spot no big than a white weasel with wonderful celerity uprising and magnifying as -PRON- rise till -PRON- turn and then there be plainly reveal two long crooked row of white glisten tooth float up from the undiscoverable bottom
chapter_133	-PRON- be moby dick 's open mouth and scroll jaw -PRON- vast shadowed bulk still half blend with the blue of the sea
chapter_133	the glitter mouth yawn beneath the boat like an open door marble tomb and give one sidelong sweep with -PRON- steering oar ahab whirl the craft aside from this tremendous apparition
chapter_133	then call upon fedallah to change place with -PRON- go forward to the bow and seize perth 's harpoon command -PRON- crew to grasp -PRON- oar and stand by to stern now by reason of this timely spinning round the boat upon -PRON- axis -PRON- bow by anticipation be make to face the whale 's head while yet under water
chapter_133	but as if perceive this stratagem moby dick with that malicious intelligence ascribe to -PRON- sidelingly transplanted -PRON- as -PRON- be in an instant shoot -PRON- pleated head lengthwise beneath the boat
chapter_133	through and through through every plank and each rib -PRON- thrill for an instant the whale obliquely lie on -PRON- back in the manner of a bite shark slowly and feelingly take -PRON- bow full within -PRON- mouth so that the long narrow scroll low jaw curl high up into the open air and one of the tooth catch in a row lock
chapter_133	with unastonished eye fedallah gaze and cross -PRON- arm but the tiger yellow crew be tumble over each other 's head to gain the uttermost stern
chapter_133	as now -PRON- thus vainly strive the jaw slip from -PRON- the frail gunwale bend in collapse and snap as both jaw like an enormous shear slide further aft bit the craft completely in twain and lock -PRON- fast again in the sea midway between the two float wreck
chapter_133	these float aside the broken end droop the crew at the stern wreck cling to the gunwale and strive to hold fast to the oar to lash -PRON- across
chapter_133	at that prelude moment ere the boat be yet snap ahab the first to perceive the whale 's intent by the crafty upraising of -PRON- head a movement that loose -PRON- hold for the time at that moment -PRON- hand have make one final effort to push the boat out of the bite
chapter_133	but only slip further into the whale 's mouth and tilt over sideways as -PRON- slip the boat have shake off -PRON- hold on the jaw spill -PRON- out of -PRON- as -PRON- lean to the push and so -PRON- fall flat face upon the sea ripplingly withdraw from -PRON- prey moby dick now lie at a little distance vertically thrust -PRON- oblong white head up and down in the billow and at the same time slowly revolve -PRON- whole spindled body so that when -PRON- vast wrinkled forehead rise some twenty or more foot out of the water the now rise swell with all -PRON- confluent wave dazzlingly break against -PRON- vindictively toss -PRON- shiver spray still higher into the air
chapter_133	so in a gale the but half baffle channel billow only recoil from the base of the eddystone triumphantly to overleap -PRON- summit with -PRON- scud
chapter_133	-PRON- receive -PRON- designation pitchpol from -PRON- be liken to that preliminary up and down poise of the whale lance in the exercise call pitchpoling previously describe
chapter_133	by this motion the whale must good and most comprehensively view whatev object may be encircle -PRON-
chapter_133	but soon resume -PRON- horizontal attitude moby dick swim swiftly round and round the wreck crew sideways churn the water in -PRON- vengeful wake as if lash -PRON- up to still another and more deadly assault
chapter_133	the sight of the splintered boat seem to madden -PRON- as the blood of grape and mulberry cast before antiochus 's elephant in the book of maccabees
chapter_133	from the boat 's fragmentary stern fedallah incuriously and mildly eyed -PRON- the cling crew at the other drifting end could not succor -PRON- more than enough be -PRON- for -PRON- to look to -PRON-
chapter_133	for so revolvingly appalling be the white whale 's aspect and so planetarily swift the ever contracting circle -PRON- make that -PRON- seem horizontally swoop upon -PRON-
chapter_133	and though the other boat unharmed still hover hard by still -PRON- dare not pull into the eddy to strike lest that should be the signal for the instant destruction of the jeopardized castaway ahab and all nor in that case could -PRON- -PRON- hope to escape
chapter_133	"meantime from the beginning all this have be descry from the ship 's mast head and square -PRON- yard -PRON- have bear down upon the scene and be now so nigh that ahab in the water hail her!--""sail on the but that moment a break sea dash on -PRON- from moby dick and whelm -PRON- for the time"
chapter_133	the pequod 's prow be point and break up the charmed circle -PRON- effectually part the white whale from -PRON- victim
chapter_133	as -PRON- sullenly swim off the boat fly to the rescue drag into stubb 's boat with blood shot blinded eye the white brine cake in -PRON- wrinkle the long tension of ahab 's bodily strength do crack and helplessly -PRON- yield to -PRON- body 's doom for a time lie all crush in the bottom of stubb 's boat like one trodden under foot of herd of elephant
chapter_133	but so much the more abbreviate -PRON-
chapter_133	"the harpoon say ahab half way rise and draggingly lean on one bend arm--""is -PRON- safe"

chapter_133	so so -PRON- see -PRON-
chapter_133	go to leeward still what a leap spout!--hand off from -PRON-
chapter_133	the eternal sap run up in ahab 's bone again
chapter_133	set the sail out oar the helm
chapter_133	d'ye see -PRON-
chapter_133	and if the reply be no sir
chapter_133	straightway -PRON- command -PRON- to lift -PRON- to -PRON- perch
chapter_133	in this way the day wear on ahab now aloft and motionless anon unrestingly pace the plank
chapter_133	as -PRON- be thus walk utter no sound except to hail the man aloft or to bid -PRON- hoist a sail still high or to spread one to a still great breadth thus to and fro pacing beneath -PRON- slouched hat at every turn -PRON- pass -PRON- own wrecked boat which have be drop upon the quarter deck and lie there reverse break bow to shatter stern
chapter_133	at last -PRON- pause before -PRON- and as in an already over clouded sky fresh troop of cloud will sometimes sail across so over the old man 's face there now steal some such add gloom as this

chapter_133	aye sir say starbuck drawing near tis a solemn sight an omen and an ill one
chapter_133	oman the dictionary
chapter_133	ye two be the opposite pole of one thing starbuck be stubb reverse and stubb be starbuck and ye two be all mankind and ahab stand alone among the million of the people earth nor god nor man -PRON- neighbor

chapter_134	-PRON- travel faster than -PRON- think for
chapter_134	the top gallant sails!--aye -PRON- should have be keep on -PRON- all night
chapter_134	here be -PRON- say that this pertinacious pursuit of one particular whale continue through day into night and through night into day be a thing by no means unprecedented in the south sea fishery
chapter_134	for such be the wonderful skill prescience of experience and invincible confidence acquire by some great natural genius among the nantucket commander that from the simple observation of a whale when last descry -PRON- will under certain give circumstance pretty accurately foretell both the direction in which -PRON- will continue to swim for a time while out of sight as well as -PRON- probable rate of progression during that period
chapter_134	and in these case somewhat as a pilot when about lose sight of a coast whose general trend -PRON- well know and which -PRON- desire shortly to return to again but at some further point like as this pilot stand by -PRON- compass and take the precise bearing of the cape at present visible in order the more certainly to hit aright the remote unseen headland eventually to be visit so do the fisherman at -PRON- compass with the whale for after be chase and diligently mark through several hour of daylight then when night obscure the fish the creature 's future wake through the darkness be almost as establish to the sagacious mind of the hunter as the pilot 's coast be to -PRON-
chapter_134	so that to this hunter 's wondrous skill the proverbial evanescence of a thing writ in water a wake be to all desire purpose well nigh as reliable as the steadfast land
chapter_134	by salt and hemp
chapter_134	cry stubb but this swift motion of the deck creep up one 's leg and tingle at the heart
chapter_134	this ship and -PRON- be two brave fellows!--ha ha
chapter_134	ha ha
chapter_134	there -PRON- blow -PRON- blows!--she blows!--right ahead be now the mast head cry

chapter_134	the mad fiend -PRON- be after ye
chapter_134	and stubb do but speak out for well nigh all that crew
chapter_134	the frenzy of the chase have by this time work -PRON- bubblingly up like old wine work anew
chapter_134	whatev pale fear and foreboding some of -PRON- may have feel before these be not only now keep out of sight through the grow awe of ahab but -PRON- be break up and on all side rout as timid prairie hare that scatter before the bound bison
chapter_134	the hand of fate have snatch all -PRON- soul and by the stirring peril of the previous day the rack of the past night 's suspense the fix unfearing blind reckless way in which -PRON- wild craft go plunge towards -PRON- flying mark by all these thing -PRON- heart be bowl along
chapter_134	-PRON- be one man not thirty
chapter_134	for as the one ship that hold -PRON- all though -PRON- be put together of all contrast thing oak and maple and pine wood iron and pitch and hemp yet all these run into each other in the one concrete hull which shoot on -PRON- way both balance and direct by the long central keel even so all the individuality of the crew this man 's valor that man 's fear guilt and guiltiness all variety be weld into oneness and be all direct to that fatal goal which ahab -PRON- one lord and keel do point to
chapter_134	the rigging live
chapter_134	the mast head like the top of tall palm be outspreadingly tuft with arm and leg
chapter_134	ah
chapter_134	how -PRON- still strove through that infinite blueness to seek out the thing that may destroy -PRON-
chapter_134	why sing ye not out for -PRON- if ye see -PRON-
chapter_134	cry ahab when after the lapse of some minute since the first cry no more have be hear
chapter_134	sway -PRON- up man ye have be deceive not moby dick cast one odd jet that way and then disappear
chapter_134	moby dick bodily burst into view
chapter_134	for not by any calm and indolent spouting not by the peaceable gush of that mystic fountain in -PRON- head do the white whale now reveal -PRON- vicinity but by the far more wondrous phenomenon of breach
chapter_134	rise with -PRON- utmost velocity from the furth depth the sperm whale thus boom -PRON- entire bulk into the pure element of air and pile up a mountain of dazzle foam show -PRON- place to the distance of seven mile and more
chapter_134	in those moment the tear enraged wave -PRON- shake off seem -PRON- mane in some case this breach be -PRON- act of defiance
chapter_134	there -PRON- breach
chapter_134	there -PRON- breach
chapter_134	be the cry as in -PRON- immeasurable bravado the white whale toss -PRON- salmon like to heaven
chapter_134	so suddenly see in the blue plain of the sea and relieved against the still blue margin of the sky the spray that -PRON- raise for the moment intolerably glitter and glare like a glacier and stand there gradually fade and fade away from -PRON- first sparkle intensity to the dim mistiness of an advance shower in a vale
chapter_134	aye breach -PRON- last to the sun moby dick
chapter_134	cry ahab thy hour and thy harpoon be at hand!--down down all of ye but one man at the fore
chapter_134	the boats!--stand by
chapter_134	unmindful of the tedious rope ladder of the shroud the man like shooting star slide to the deck by the isolated backstay and halyard while ahab less dartingly but still rapidly be drop from -PRON- perch
chapter_134	mr. starbuck the ship be thine keep away from the boat but keep near -PRON-
chapter_134	low all
chapter_134	as if to strike a quick terror into -PRON- by this time be the first assailant -PRON- moby dick have turn and be now come for the three crew
chapter_134	ahab 's boat be central and cheer -PRON- man -PRON- tell -PRON- -PRON- would take the whale head and head that is pull straight up to -PRON- forehead a not uncommon thing for when within a certain limit such a course exclude the come onset from the whale 's sidelong vision
chapter_134	but ere that close limit be gain and while yet all three boat be plain as the ship 's three mast to -PRON- eye the white whale churn -PRON- into furious speed almost in an instant as -PRON- be rush among the boat with open jaw and a lashing tail offer appalling battle on every side and heedless of the iron dart at -PRON- from every boat seem only intent on annihilate each separate plank of which those boat be make
chapter_134	but skilfully manoeuvre incessantly wheel like train charger in the field the boat for a while elude -PRON- though at time but by a plank 's breadth while all the time ahab 's unearthly slogan tear every other cry but -PRON- to shred
chapter_134	but at last in -PRON- untraceable evolution the white whale so cross and recross and in a thousand way entangle the slack of the three line now fast to -PRON- that -PRON- foreshorten and of -PRON- warp the devoted boat towards the plant iron in -PRON- though now for a moment the whale draw aside a little as if to rally for a more tremendous charge
chapter_134	caught and twisted corkscrew in the maze of the line loose harpoon and lance with all -PRON- bristle barb and point come flashing and drip up to the chock in the bow of ahab 's boat
chapter_134	only one thing could be do
chapter_134	the white whale make a sudden rush among the remain tangle of the other line by so do irresistibly drag the more involved boat of stubb and flask towards -PRON- fluke dash -PRON- together like two rolling husk on a surf beat beach and then dive down into the sea disappear in a boiling maelstrom in which for a space the odorous cedar chip of the wreck dance round and round like the grated nutmeg in a swiftly stir bowl of punch
chapter_134	while the two crew be yet circle in the water reach out after the revolving line tub oar and other float furniture while aslope little flask bob up and down like an empty vial twitch -PRON- leg upwards to escape the dread jaw of shark and stubb be lustily sing out for some one to ladle -PRON- up and while the old man 's line now part admit of -PRON- pulling into the creamy pool to rescue whom -PRON- could in that wild simultaneousness of a thousand concreted peril ahab 's yet unstricken boat seem draw up towards heaven by invisible wire as arrow like shoot perpendicularly from the sea the white whale dash -PRON- broad forehead against -PRON- bottom and send -PRON- turn over and over into the air till -PRON- fall again gunwale downwards and ahab and -PRON- man struggle out from under -PRON- like seal from a sea side cave
chapter_134	the first uprising momentum of the whale modify -PRON- direction as -PRON- strike the surface involuntarily launch -PRON- along -PRON- to a little distance from the centre of the destruction -PRON- have make and with -PRON- back to -PRON- -PRON- now lie for a moment slowly feel with -PRON- fluke from side to side and whenever a stray oar bit of plank the least chip or crumb of the boat touch -PRON- skin -PRON- tail swiftly draw back and come sideways smite the sea
chapter_134	but soon as if satisfy that -PRON- work for that time be do -PRON- push -PRON- pleated forehead through the ocean and trail after -PRON- the intertangled line continue -PRON- leeward way at a traveller 's methodic pace
chapter_134	as before the attentive ship have descry the whole fight again come bear down to the rescue and drop a boat pick up the float mariner tub oar and whatev else could be catch at and safely land -PRON- on -PRON- deck
chapter_134	some sprain shoulder wrist and ankle livid contusion wrench harpoon and lance inextricable intricacy of rope shatter oar and plank all these be there but no fatal or even serious ill seem to have befall any one
chapter_134	but when -PRON- be help to the deck all eye be fasten upon -PRON- as instead of stand by -PRON- -PRON- still half hang upon the shoulder of starbuck who have thus far be the foremost to assist -PRON-
chapter_134	-PRON- ivory leg have be snap off leave but one short sharp splinter

chapter_135	"heart of wrought steel murmur starbuck gaze over the side and follow with -PRON- eye the recede boat--""canst thou yet ring boldly to that sight"
chapter_135	lower thy keel among ravening shark and follow by -PRON- open mouthed to the chase and this the critical third day

chapter_135	a low rumble sound be hear a subterraneous hum and then all hold -PRON- breath as bedraggled with trail rope and harpoon and lance a vast form shot lengthwise but obliquely from the sea
chapter_135	shroud in a thin droop veil of mist -PRON- hover for a moment in the rainbowed air and then fall swamp back into the deep

chapter_135	moby dick seek thee not
chapter_135	set sail to the rise wind the lonely boat be swiftly impel to leeward by both oar and canvas
chapter_135	glancing upwards -PRON- see tashtego queequeg and daggoo eagerly mount to the three mast head while the oarsman be rock in the two stave boat which have but just be hoist to the side and be busily at work in repair -PRON-
chapter_135	one after the other through the port hole as -PRON- speed -PRON- also catch fly glimpse of stubb and flask busy -PRON- on deck among bundle of new iron and lance

chapter_135	but -PRON- rally
chapter_135	and now mark that the vane or flag be go from the main mast head -PRON- shout to tashtego who have just gain that perch to descend again for another flag and a hammer and nail and so nail -PRON- to the mast
chapter_135	and still as ahab glide over the wave the unpity shark accompany -PRON- and so pertinaciously stick to the boat and so continually bit at the ply oar that the blade become jagged and crunch and leave small splinter in the sea at almost every dip
chapter_135	heed -PRON- not

chapter_135	as -PRON- be three of the oarsman who foreknow not the precise instant of the dart and be therefore unprepared for -PRON- effect these be fling out but so fall that in an instant two of -PRON- clutch the gunwale again and rise to -PRON- level on a combing wave hurl -PRON- bodily inboard again the third man helplessly drop astern but still afloat and swimming
chapter_135	almost simultaneously with a mighty volition of ungraduated instantaneous swiftness the white whale dart through the weltering sea
chapter_135	but when ahab cry out to the steersman to take new turn with the line and hold -PRON- so and command the crew to turn round on -PRON- seat and tow the boat up to the mark the moment the treacherous line feel that double strain and tug -PRON- snap in the empty air what break in -PRON-

chapter_135	the ship
chapter_135	the hearse!--the second hearse cry ahab from the boat -PRON- wood could only be american
chapter_135	diving beneath the settle ship the whale run quiver along -PRON- keel but turn under water swiftly shoot to the surface again far off the other bow but within a few yard of ahab 's boat where for a time -PRON- lie quiescent
chapter_135	-PRON- turn -PRON- body from the sun
chapter_135	let -PRON- hear thy hammer

chapter_135	and now concentric circle seize the lone boat -PRON- and all -PRON- crew and each float oar and every lance pole and spinning animate and inanimate all round and round in one vortex carry the small chip of the pequod out of sight
chapter_135	but as the last whelming intermixingly pour -PRON- over the sunken head of the indian at the mainmast leave a few inch of the erect spar yet visible together with long streaming yard of the flag which calmly undulate with ironical coinciding over the destroy billow -PRON- almost touch at that instant a red arm and a hammer hover backwardly uplift in the open air in the act of nail the flag faster and yet fast to the subside spar

chapter_135	when -PRON- reach -PRON- -PRON- have subside to a creamy pool
chapter_135	round and round then and ever contract towards the button like black bubble at the axis of that slowly wheel circle like another ixion -PRON- do revolve
