chapter_16	scorn a turnstile wheel at -PRON- reverend helm -PRON- sport there a tiller and that tiller be in one mass curiously carve from the long narrow low jaw of -PRON- hereditary foe
chapter_16	plant with -PRON- broad end on the deck a circle of these slab lace together mutually sloped towards each other and at the apex unite in a tufted point where the loose hairy fibre wave to and fro like the top knot on some old pottowottamie sachem 's head

chapter_16	for some of these same quakers be the most sanguinary of all sailor and whale hunter
chapter_16	how now in the contemplative evening of -PRON- day the pious bildad reconcile these thing in the reminiscence -PRON- do not know but -PRON- do not seem to concern -PRON- much and very probably -PRON- have long since come to the sage and sensible conclusion that a man 's religion be one thing and this practical world quite another
chapter_16	indolence and idleness perish before -PRON-
chapter_16	the space between the deck be small and there bolt upright sit old bildad who always sit so and never lean and this to save -PRON- coat tail

chapter_16	-PRON- will do say bildad eye -PRON- and then go on spell away at -PRON- book in a mumble tone quite audible
chapter_16	-PRON- think -PRON- the queer old quaker -PRON- ever see especially as peleg -PRON- friend and old shipmate seem such a blusterer
chapter_16	but -PRON- say nothing only look round -PRON- sharply
chapter_16	-PRON- begin to think -PRON- be high time to settle with -PRON- at what term -PRON- would be willing to engage for the voyage
chapter_16	and though the 275th lay be what -PRON- call a rather long lay yet -PRON- be good than nothing and if -PRON- have a lucky voyage may pretty nearly pay for the clothing -PRON- would wear out on -PRON- not to speak of -PRON- three year beef and board for which -PRON- would not have to pay one stiver
chapter_16	now while peleg be vainly try to mend a pen with -PRON- jack knife old bildad to -PRON- no small surprise consider that -PRON- be such an interested party in these proceeding bildad never heed -PRON- but go on mumble to -PRON- out of -PRON- book lay not up for yourself treasure upon earth where moth-- well captain bildad interrupt peleg what d'ye say what lie shall -PRON- give this young man

chapter_17	close the door upon the landlady -PRON- endeavor to prevail upon queequeg to take a chair but in vain
chapter_17	there -PRON- sit and all -PRON- could do for all -PRON- polite art and blandishment -PRON- would not move a peg nor say a single word nor even look at -PRON- nor notice -PRON- presence in the slight way
chapter_17	-PRON- go down to supper
chapter_17	-PRON- will starve -PRON- will kill -PRON- queequeg
chapter_17	-PRON- have blow out the candle and the mere thought of queequeg not four foot off sit there in that uneasy position stark alone in the cold and dark this make -PRON- really wretched

chapter_18	bildad say no more but button up -PRON- coat stalk on deck where -PRON- follow -PRON-
chapter_19	queequeg and -PRON- have just leave the pequod and be saunter away from the water for the moment each occupy with -PRON- own thought when the above word be put to -PRON- by a stranger who pause before -PRON- level -PRON- massive forefinger at the vessel in question
chapter_19	-PRON- repeat
chapter_19	queequeg say -PRON- let -PRON- go this fellow have break loose from somewhere -PRON- be talk about something and somebody -PRON- do not know
chapter_19	-PRON- be sick -PRON- say but be get good and will be all right again before long
chapter_19	say that
chapter_19	-PRON- do not tell much of anything about -PRON- only -PRON- have hear that -PRON- be a good whale hunter and a good captain to -PRON- crew
chapter_19	nothing about the silver calabash -PRON- spit into
chapter_19	and nothing about -PRON- lose -PRON- leg last voyage accord to the prophecy
chapter_19	not all nantucket -PRON- guess
chapter_19	but hows'ever mayhap ye've hear tell about the leg and how -PRON- lose -PRON- aye ye have hear of that -PRON- dare say
chapter_19	-PRON- friend say -PRON- what all this gibberish of -PRON- be about -PRON- do not know and -PRON- do not much care for -PRON- seem to -PRON- that -PRON- must be a little damage in the head
chapter_19	pretty sure
chapter_19	well well what be sign be sign and what be to be will be and then again perhaps -PRON- will not be after all
chapter_19	the ineffable heaven bless ye -PRON- be sorry -PRON- stop ye
chapter_19	and -PRON- be say very well and -PRON- like to hear a chap talk up that way -PRON- be just the man for -PRON- the like of ye
chapter_19	morning to ye shipmate morning
chapter_19	morning -PRON- be say i.
chapter_19	this relieve -PRON- and once more and finally as -PRON- seem to -PRON- -PRON- pronounce -PRON- in -PRON- heart a humbug
chapter_20	captain peleg seldom or never go ashore but sit in -PRON- wigwam keep a sharp look out upon the hand
chapter_20	just so with whaling which necessitate a three year housekeeping upon the wide ocean far from all grocer costermonger doctor baker and banker
chapter_20	hence the spare boat spare spar and spare line and harpoon and spare everything almost but a spare captain and duplicate ship
chapter_20	but as before hint for some time there be a continual fetching and carry on board of diver odd and end of thing both large and small chief among those who do this fetch and carrying be captain bildad 's sister a lean old lady of a most determined and indefatigable spirit but withal very kindhearted who seem resolve that if she could help -PRON- nothing should be find want in the pequod after once fairly get to sea
chapter_20	to these question -PRON- would answer that -PRON- be get good and better and be expect aboard every day meantime the two captain peleg and bildad could attend to everything necessary to fit the vessel for the voyage
chapter_20	so next morning queequeg and -PRON- take a very early start
chapter_21	be not go aboard then
chapter_21	
chapter_21	strike by this plain matter of fact question -PRON- answer say
chapter_21	yes -PRON- think -PRON- do see four or five man but -PRON- be too dim to be sure
chapter_21	-PRON- be go to warn ye against but never mind never mind -PRON- be all one all in the family too sharp frost this morning be not -PRON-
chapter_21	and with these crack word -PRON- finally depart leave -PRON- for the moment in no small wonderment at -PRON- frantic impudence
chapter_21	go forward to the forecastle -PRON- find the slide of the scuttle open
chapter_21	-PRON- put -PRON- hand upon the sleeper 's rear as though feel if -PRON- be soft enough and then without more ado sit quietly down there
chapter_21	gracious
chapter_21	queequeg do not sit there say i.
chapter_21	very benevolent countenance then but how hard -PRON- breathe -PRON- be heave -PRON- get off queequeg
chapter_21	queequeg remove -PRON- to just beyond the head of the sleeper and light -PRON- tomahawk pipe
chapter_21	meanwhile upon question -PRON- in -PRON- broken fashion queequeg give -PRON- to understand that in -PRON- land owe to the absence of settee and sofa of all sort the king chief and great people generally be in the custom of fatten some of the low order for othman and to furnish a house comfortably in that respect -PRON- have only to buy up eight or ten lazy fellow and lie -PRON- round in the pier and alcove
chapter_21	besides -PRON- be very convenient on an excursion much better than those garden chair which be convertible into walking stick upon occasion a chief call -PRON- attendant and desire -PRON- to make a settee of -PRON- under a spread tree perhaps in some damp marshy place
chapter_21	while narrate these thing every time queequeg receive the tomahawk from -PRON- -PRON- flourish the hatchet side of -PRON- over the sleeper 's head
chapter_21	-PRON- be go on with some wild reminiscence about -PRON- tomahawk pipe which -PRON- seem have in -PRON- two us both brained -PRON- foe and soothe -PRON- soul when -PRON- be directly attract to the sleeping rigger
chapter_21	the strong vapour now completely fill the contract hole -PRON- begin to tell upon -PRON-
chapter_21	
chapter_21	-PRON- sail to day
chapter_21	the captain come aboard last night
chapter_21	what captain ahab
chapter_22	at length towards noon upon the final dismissal of the ship 's rigger and after the pequod have be haul out from the wharf and after the ever thoughtful charity have come off in a whale boat with -PRON- last gift a night cap for stubb the second mate -PRON- brother in law and a spare bible for the steward after all this the two captains peleg and bildad issue from the cabin and turn to the chief mate peleg say
chapter_22	captain ahab be all ready just speak to -PRON- nothing more to be get from shore eh
chapter_22	but then the idea be that -PRON- presence be by no mean necessary in get the ship under weigh and steer -PRON- well out to sea
chapter_22	mr. starbuck drive'em aft
chapter_22	
chapter_22	nevertheless not three day previous bildad have tell -PRON- that no profane song would be allow on board the pequod particularly in get under weigh and charity -PRON- sister have place a small choice copy of watts in each seaman 's berth
chapter_22	the long row of tooth on the bulwark glisten in the moonlight and like the white ivory tusk of some huge elephant vast curving icicle depend from the bow
chapter_22	at last -PRON- gain such an offing that the two pilot be need no longer
chapter_22	as for peleg -PRON- -PRON- take -PRON- more like a philosopher but for all -PRON- philosophy there be a tear twinkling in -PRON- eye when the lantern come too near
chapter_22	be careful in the hunt ye mate
chapter_22	the sail needle be in the green locker
chapter_22	have an eye to the molass tierce mr. stubb -PRON- be a little leaky -PRON- think
chapter_22	if ye touch at the island mr. flask beware of fornication
chapter_22	do not keep that cheese too long down in the hold mr. starbuck -PRON- will spoil
chapter_22	and with that peleg hurry -PRON- over the side and both dropt into the boat
chapter_23	be all this agony so vain
chapter_23	up from the spray of thy ocean perish straight up leap thy apotheosis
chapter_24	but butcher also and butcher of the bloody badge have be all martial commanders whom the world invariably delight to honour
chapter_24	but though the world scout at -PRON- whale hunter yet do -PRON- unwittingly pay -PRON- the profound homage yea an all abound adoration for almost all the taper lamp and candle that burn round the globe burn as before so many shrine to -PRON- glory
chapter_24	why do the dutch in de witt 's time have admiral of -PRON- whaling fleet
chapter_24	why do louis xvi
chapter_24	why do britain between the year 1750 and 1788 pay to -PRON- whaleman in bounty upwards of l1,000,000
chapter_24	-PRON- freely assert that the cosmopolite philosopher can not for -PRON- life point out one single peaceful influence which within the last sixty year have operate more potentially upon the whole broad world take in one aggregate than the high and mighty business of whaling
chapter_24	-PRON- would be a hopeless endless task to catalogue all these thing
chapter_24	-PRON- have explore sea and archipelago which have no chart where no cook or vancouver have ever sail
chapter_24	-PRON- may celebrate as -PRON- will the hero of exploring expeditions -PRON- cooks -PRON- krusenstern but -PRON- say that score of anonymous captains have sail out of nantucket that be as great and great than -PRON- cook and -PRON- krusenstern
chapter_24	all that be make such a flourish of in the old south sea voyages those thing be but the life time commonplace of -PRON- heroic nantucketers
chapter_24	oh the world
chapter_24	but if in the face of all this -PRON- still declare that whaling have no aesthetically noble association connect with -PRON- then be -PRON- ready to shiver fifty lance with -PRON- there and unhorse -PRON- with a split helmet every time
chapter_24	who write the first account of -PRON- leviathan
chapter_24	and who pronounce -PRON- glow eulogy in parliament
chapter_24	who but edmund burke
chapter_24	by old english statutory law the whale be declare a royal fish
chapter_24	the whale -PRON- have never figure in any grand impose way
chapter_24	grant -PRON- since -PRON- cite -PRON- but say what -PRON- will there be no real dignity in whaling
chapter_24	in -PRON- desk then here -PRON- prospectively ascribe all the honour and the glory to whaling for a whale ship be -PRON- yale college and -PRON- harvard
chapter_25	-PRON- whalemen supply -PRON- king and queen with coronation stuff
chapter_26	a staid steadfast man whose life for the most part be a tell pantomime of action and not a tame chapter of sound
chapter_26	and if at time these thing bend the weld iron of -PRON- soul much more do -PRON- far away domestic memory of -PRON- young cape wife and child tend to bend -PRON- still more from the original ruggedness of -PRON- nature and open -PRON- still further to those latent influence which in some honest hearted man restrain the gush of dare devil daring so often evince by other in the more perilous vicissitude of the fishery
chapter_26	but be the come narrative to reveal in any instance the complete abasement of poor starbuck 's fortitude scarce may -PRON- have the heart to write -PRON- for -PRON- be a thing most sorrowful nay shocking to expose the fall of valour in the soul
chapter_26	the great god absolute
chapter_26	-PRON- omnipresence -PRON- divine equality
chapter_26	bear -PRON- out in -PRON- thou great democratic god who didst not refuse to the swart convict bunyan the pale poetic pearl
chapter_26	thou who in all thy mighty earthly marching ever cullest thy select champion from the kingly common bear -PRON- out in -PRON- o god
chapter_27	for like -PRON- nose -PRON- short black little pipe be one of the regular feature of -PRON- face
chapter_27	for when stubb dress instead of first put -PRON- leg into -PRON- trowser -PRON- put -PRON- pipe into -PRON- mouth
chapter_27	so utterly lose be -PRON- to all sense of reverence for the many marvel of -PRON- majestic bulk and mystic way and so dead to anything like an apprehension of any possible danger from encounter -PRON- that in -PRON- poor opinion the wondrous whale be but a species of magnified mouse or at least water rat require only a little circumvention and some small application of time and trouble in order to kill and boil
chapter_27	this ignorant unconscious fearlessness of -PRON- make -PRON- a little waggish in the matter of whale -PRON- follow these fish for the fun of -PRON- and a three year voyage round cape horn be only a jolly joke that last that length of time
chapter_27	to look at the tawny brawn of -PRON- lithe snaky limb -PRON- would almost have credit the superstition of some of the early puritans and half believe this wild indian to be a son of the prince of the powers of the air
chapter_27	in -PRON- youth daggoo have voluntarily ship on board of a whaler lie in a lonely bay on -PRON- native coast
chapter_27	there be a corporeal humility in look up at -PRON- and a white man stand before -PRON- seem a white flag come to beg truce of a fortress
chapter_27	black little pip -PRON- never do
chapter_28	ahab
chapter_28	yes -PRON- supreme lord and dictator be there though hitherto unseen by any eye not permit to penetrate into the now sacred retreat of the cabin
chapter_28	every time -PRON- ascend to the deck from -PRON- watch below -PRON- instantly gaze aft to mark if any strange face be visible for -PRON- first vague disquietude touch the unknown captain now in the seclusion of the sea become almost a perturbation
chapter_28	but poorly could -PRON- withstand -PRON- much as in other mood -PRON- be almost ready to smile at the solemn whimsicality of that outlandish prophet of the wharf
chapter_28	right down one side of -PRON- tawny scorch face and neck
chapter_28	whether that mark be bear with -PRON- or whether -PRON- be the scar leave by some desperate wound no one could certainly say
chapter_28	but once tashtego 's senior an old gay head indian among the crew superstitiously assert that not till -PRON- be full forty year old do ahab become that way brand and then -PRON- come upon -PRON- not in the fury of any mortal fray but in an elemental strife at sea
chapter_28	-PRON- have previously come to -PRON- that this ivory leg have at sea be fashioned from the polished bone of the sperm whale 's jaw
chapter_28	but after that morning -PRON- be every day visible to the crew either standing in -PRON- pivot hole or seat upon an ivory stool -PRON- have or heavily walk the deck
chapter_28	and by and by -PRON- come to pass that -PRON- be almost continually in the air but as yet for all that -PRON- say or perceptibly do on the at last sunny deck -PRON- seem as unnecessary there as another mast
chapter_28	more than once do -PRON- put forth the faint blossom of a look which in any other man would have soon flower out in a smile
chapter_29	some day elapse and ice and iceberg all astern the pequod now go roll through the bright quito spring which at sea almost perpetually reign on the threshold of the eternal august of the tropic
chapter_29	the warmly cool clear ring perfumed overflowing redundant day be as crystal goblet of persian sherbet heap up flake up with rose water snow
chapter_29	but all the witchery of that unwan weather do not merely lend new spell and potency to the outward world
chapter_29	inward -PRON- turn upon the soul especially when the still mild hour of eve come on then memory shoot -PRON- crystal as the clear ice most form of noiseless twilight
chapter_29	"-PRON- feel like go down into one 's tomb -PRON- would mutter to himself--""for an old captain like -PRON- to be descend this narrow scuttle to go to -PRON- grave dig berth"
chapter_29	so almost every twenty four hour when the watch of the night be set and the band on deck sentinell the slumber of the band below and when if a rope be to be haul upon the forecastle the sailor fling -PRON- not rudely down as by day but with some cautiousness dropt -PRON- to -PRON- place for fear of disturb -PRON- slumber shipmate when this sort of steady quietude would begin to prevail habitually the silent steersman would watch the cabin scuttle and ere long the old man would emerge grip at the iron banister to help -PRON- crippled way
chapter_29	start at the unforseen conclude exclamation of the so suddenly scornful old man stubb be speechless a moment then say excitedly -PRON- be not use to be speak to that way sir -PRON- do but less than half like -PRON- sir
chapter_29	-PRON- be very queer
chapter_29	down here on -PRON- knee and pray for -PRON-
chapter_29	-PRON- be queer very queer and -PRON- be queer too aye take -PRON- fore and aft -PRON- be about the queer old man stubb ever sail with
chapter_29	-PRON- be not in -PRON- bed now either more than three hour out of the twenty four and -PRON- do not sleep then
chapter_29	do not that dough boy the steward tell -PRON- that of a morning -PRON- always find the old man 's hammock clothe all rumpled and tumble and the sheet down at the foot and the coverlid almost tie into knot and the pillow a sort of frightful hot as though a baked brick have be on -PRON-
chapter_29	-PRON- guess -PRON- be get what some folk ashore call a conscience -PRON- be a kind of tic dolly row -PRON- say bad nor a toothache
chapter_29	well well -PRON- do not know what -PRON- be but the lord keep -PRON- from catch -PRON-
chapter_29	think not be -PRON- eleventh commandment and sleep when -PRON- can be -PRON- twelfth
chapter_29	how
chapter_30	light the pipe at the binnacle lamp and plant the stool on the weather side of the deck -PRON- sit and smoke
chapter_30	some moment pass during which the thick vapour come from -PRON- mouth in quick and constant puff which blow back again into -PRON- face
chapter_30	how now -PRON- soliloquize at last withdraw the tube this smoke no longer soothe
chapter_30	-PRON- will smoke no more--
chapter_30	-PRON- toss the still light pipe into the sea
chapter_30	with slouched hat ahab lurchingly pace the plank
chapter_31	yes think -PRON- -PRON- be only a playful cudgelling in fact only a whaleboning that -PRON- give -PRON- not a base kick
chapter_31	besides think -PRON- look at -PRON- once why the end of -PRON- the foot part what a small sort of end -PRON- be whereas if a broad footed farmer kick -PRON- there be a devilish broad insult
chapter_31	what be -PRON- bout say -PRON-
chapter_31	but -PRON- have only just lift -PRON- foot for -PRON- when -PRON- roar out stop that kick
chapter_31	look ye here say -PRON- let -PRON- argue the insult
chapter_31	captain ahab kick ye do not -PRON-
chapter_31	yes -PRON- do say
chapter_31	here -PRON- be
chapter_31	i.
chapter_31	no -PRON- be kick by a great man and with a beautiful ivory leg stubb
chapter_31	listen wise stubb
chapter_31	in old england the great lord think -PRON- great glory to be slap by a queen and make garter knight of but be your boast stubb that ye be kick by old ahab and make a wise man of
chapter_31	do not -PRON- see that pyramid
chapter_31	-PRON- snore roll over and there -PRON- be in -PRON- hammock
chapter_31	but mum -PRON- come this way
chapter_32	no branch of zoology be so much involved as that which be entitle cetology say captain scoresby a.d. 1820
chapter_32	and here be -PRON- say that the greenland whale be an usurper upon the throne of the sea
chapter_32	the original matter touch the sperm whale to be find in -PRON- volume be necessarily small but so far as -PRON- go -PRON- be of excellent quality though mostly confine to scientific description
chapter_32	far above all other hunt whale -PRON- be an unwritten life
chapter_32	-PRON- object here be simply to project the draught of a systematization of cetology
chapter_32	will -PRON- the leviathan make a covenant with thee
chapter_32	first the uncertain unsettled condition of this science of cetology be in the very vestibule attest by the fact that in some quarter -PRON- still remain a moot point whether a whale be a fish
chapter_32	-PRON- submit all this to -PRON- friend simeon macey and charley coffin of nantucket both messmate of mine in a certain voyage and -PRON- unite in the opinion that the reason set forth be altogether insufficient
chapter_32	above linnaeus have give -PRON- those item
chapter_32	next how shall -PRON- define the whale by -PRON- obvious external so as conspicuously to label -PRON- for all time to come
chapter_32	to be short then a whale be a spout fish with a horizontal tail
chapter_32	however contract that definition be the result of expand meditation
chapter_32	-PRON- be chiefly with -PRON- name that -PRON- now have to do
chapter_32	some century ago when the sperm whale be almost wholly unknown in -PRON- own proper individuality and when -PRON- oil be only accidentally obtain from the strand fish in those day spermaceti -PRON- would seem be popularly suppose to be derive from a creature identical with the one then know in england as the greenland or right whale
chapter_32	right whale).--in one respect this be the most venerable of the leviathan be the one first regularly hunt by man
chapter_32	-PRON- be the whale which for more than two century past have be hunt by the dutch and english in the arctic sea -PRON- be the whale which the american fisherman have long pursue in the indian ocean on the brazil banks on the nor west coast and various other part of the world designate by -PRON-
chapter_32	the right whale will be elsewhere treat of at some length with reference to elucidate the sperm whale
chapter_32	this fin be some three or four foot long grow vertically from the hinder part of the back of an angular shape and with a very sharp pointed end
chapter_32	-PRON- seem a whale hater as some man be man hater
chapter_32	from have the baleen in -PRON- mouth the fin back be sometimes include with the right whale among a theoretic specie denominate whalebone whale that is whale with baleen
chapter_32	in connection with this appellative of whalebone whale -PRON- be of great importance to mention that however such a nomenclature may be convenient in facilitate allusion to some kind of whale yet -PRON- be in vain to attempt a clear classification of the leviathan found upon either -PRON- baleen or hump or fin or tooth notwithstanding that those marked part or feature very obviously seem better adapt to afford the basis for a regular system of cetology than any other detached bodily distinction which the whale in -PRON- kind present

chapter_32	narwhale that is nostril whale
chapter_32	another instance of a curiously name whale so name -PRON- suppose from -PRON- peculiar horn be originally mistake for a peaked nose
chapter_32	but -PRON- can not prove either of these surmise to be correct
chapter_32	-PRON- be also distil to a volatile salt for faint lady the same way that the horn of the male deer be manufacture into hartshorn

chapter_33	though the long period of a southern whaling voyage by far the long of all voyage now or ever make by man the peculiar peril of -PRON- and the community of interest prevail among a company all of whom high or low depend for -PRON- profit not upon fix wage but upon -PRON- common luck together with -PRON- common vigilance intrepidity and hard work though all these thing do in some case tend to beget a less rigorous discipline than in merchantman generally yet never mind how much like an old mesopotamian family these whaleman may in some primitive instance live together for all that the punctilious external at least of the quarter deck be seldom materially relaxed and in no instance do away
chapter_33	for be a man 's intellectual superiority what -PRON- will -PRON- can never assume the practical available supremacy over other man without the aid of some sort of external art and entrenchment always in -PRON- more or less paltry and base
chapter_34	the cabin table
chapter_34	but the third emir now see -PRON- all alone on the quarter deck seem to feel relieved from some curious restraint for tip all sort of know wink in all sort of direction and kick off -PRON- shoe -PRON- strike into a sharp but noiseless squall of a hornpipe right over the grand turk 's head and then by a dexterous sleight pitch -PRON- cap up into the mizentop for a shelf -PRON- go down rollicking so far at least as -PRON- remain visible from the deck reverse all other procession by bring up the rear with music
chapter_34	perhaps not

chapter_34	with one mind -PRON- intent eye all fasten upon the old man 's knife as -PRON- carve the chief dish before -PRON-
chapter_34	and when reach out -PRON- knife and fork between which the slice of beef be lock ahab thereby motion starbuck 's plate towards -PRON- the mate receive -PRON- meat as though receive alm and cut -PRON- tenderly and a little start if perchance the knife graze against the plate and chew -PRON- noiselessly and swallow -PRON- not without circumspection
chapter_34	whether -PRON- think the owner of the ship deny -PRON- to -PRON- on account of -PRON- clot -PRON- clear sunny complexion or whether -PRON- deem that on so long a voyage in such marketless water butter be at a premium and therefore be not for -PRON- a subaltern however -PRON- be flask alas be a butterless man
chapter_34	starbuck and stubb both have the start of -PRON- and yet -PRON- also have the privilege of lounge in the rear
chapter_34	if stubb even who be but a peg high than flask happen to have but a small appetite and soon show symptom of conclude -PRON- repast then flask must bestir -PRON- -PRON- will not get more than three mouthful that day for -PRON- be against holy usage for stubb to precede flask to the deck
chapter_34	besides if -PRON- be so that any mere sailor of the pequod have a grudge against flask in flask 's official capacity all that sailor have to do in order to obtain ample vengeance be to go aft at dinner time and get a peep at flask through the cabin sky light sit silly and dumfoundered before awful ahab
chapter_34	-PRON- seem hardly possible that by such comparatively small mouthful -PRON- could keep up the vitality diffuse through so broad baronial and superb a person
chapter_34	and when -PRON- would hear tashtego singing out for -PRON- to produce -PRON- that -PRON- bone may be pick the simple witted steward all but shatter the crockery hang round -PRON- in the pantry by -PRON- sudden fit of the palsy
chapter_34	in good time though to -PRON- great delight the three salt sea warrior would rise and depart to -PRON- credulous fable mongering ear all -PRON- martial bone jingle in -PRON- at every step like moorish scimetar in scabbard
chapter_34	but though these barbarian din in the cabin and nominally live there still be anything but sedentary in -PRON- habit -PRON- be scarcely ever in -PRON- except at mealtime and just before sleeping time when -PRON- pass through -PRON- to -PRON- own peculiar quarter
chapter_34	in this one matter ahab seem no exception to most american whale captain who as a set rather incline to the opinion that by right the ship 's cabin belong to -PRON- and that -PRON- be by courtesy alone that anybody else be at any time permit there
chapter_34	so that in real truth the mate and harpooneer of the pequod may more properly be say to have live out of the cabin than in -PRON-
chapter_35	great washington too stand high aloft on -PRON- tower main mast in baltimore and like one of hercules pillar -PRON- column mark that point of human grandeur beyond which few mortal will go
chapter_35	for the most part in this tropic whaling life a sublime uneventfulness invest -PRON- -PRON- hear no news read no gazette extra with startling account of commonplace never delude -PRON- into unnecessary excitement -PRON- hear of no domestic affliction bankrupt security fall of stock be never trouble with the thought of what -PRON- shall have for dinner for all -PRON- meal for three year and more be snugly stow in cask and -PRON- bill of fare be immutable

chapter_35	for nowadays the whale fishery furnish an asylum for many romantic melancholy and absent minded young man disgust with the carking care of earth and seek sentiment in tar and blubber
chapter_35	why thou monkey say a harpooneer to one of these lad -PRON- have be cruise now hard upon three year and thou hast not raise a whale yet
chapter_35	there be no life in thee now except that rock life impart by a gently rolling ship by -PRON- borrow from the sea by the sea from the inscrutable tide of god
chapter_35	and perhaps at mid day in the fair weather with one half throttle shriek -PRON- drop through that transparent air into the summer sea no more to rise for ever
chapter_35	heed -PRON- well ye pantheists
chapter_36	-PRON- be not a great while after the affair of the pipe that one morning shortly after breakfast ahab as be -PRON- will not ascend the cabin gangway to the deck
chapter_36	there most sea captain usually walk at that hour as country gentleman after the same meal take a few turn in the garden
chapter_36	the hour wear on ahab now shut up within -PRON- cabin anon pace the deck with the same intense bigotry of purpose in -PRON- aspect
chapter_36	-PRON- draw near the close of day
chapter_36	suddenly -PRON- come to a halt by the bulwark and insert -PRON- bone leg into the auger hole there and with one hand grasp a shroud -PRON- order starbuck to send everybody aft

chapter_36	receive the top maul from starbuck -PRON- advance towards the main mast with the hammer uplift in one hand exhibit the gold with the other and with a high raise voice exclaim whosoever of ye raise -PRON- a white head whale with a wrinkled brow and a crooked jaw whosoever of ye raise -PRON- that white head whale with three hole puncture in -PRON- starboard fluke look ye whosoev of ye raise -PRON- that same white whale -PRON- shall have this gold ounce -PRON- boy
chapter_36	all this while tashtego daggoo and queequeg have look on with even more intense interest and surprise than the rest and at the mention of the wrinkled brow and crooked jaw -PRON- have start as if each be separately touch by some specific recollection
chapter_36	
chapter_36	and -PRON- have one two three
chapter_36	oh
chapter_36	captain ahab say starbuck who with stubb and flask have thus far be eye -PRON- superior with increase surprise but at last seem strike with a thought which somewhat explain all the wonder
chapter_36	-PRON- stand on now
chapter_36	then toss both arm with measureless imprecation -PRON- shout out aye aye and -PRON- will chase -PRON- round good hope and round the horn and round the norway maelstrom and round perdition 's flame before -PRON- give -PRON- up

chapter_41	and as for those who previously hear of the white whale by chance catch sight of -PRON- in the beginning of the thing -PRON- have every one of -PRON- almost as boldly and fearlessly lower for -PRON- as for any other whale of that species
chapter_41	for not only be whaleman as a body unexempt from that ignorance and superstitiousness hereditary to all sailor but of all sailor -PRON- be by all odd the most directly bring into contact with whatev be appallingly astonishing in the sea face to face -PRON- not only eye -PRON- great marvel but hand to jaw give battle to -PRON-
chapter_41	so that in many case such a panic do -PRON- finally strike that few who by those rumor at least have hear of the white whale few of those hunter be willing to encounter the peril of -PRON- jaw
chapter_41	not even at the present day have the original prestige of the sperm whale as fearfully distinguished from all other specie of the leviathan die out of the mind of the whaleman as a body
chapter_41	force into familiarity then with such prodigy as these and know that after repeat intrepid assault the white whale have escape alive -PRON- can not be much matter of surprise that some whaleman should go still further in -PRON- superstition declare moby dick not only ubiquitous but immortal for immortality be but ubiquity in time that though grove of spear should be plant in -PRON- flank -PRON- would still swim away unharmed or if indeed -PRON- should ever be make to spout thick blood such a sight would be but a ghastly deception for again in unensanguined billow hundred of league away -PRON- unsullied jet would once more be see
chapter_41	judge then to what pitch of inflamed distracted fury the mind of -PRON- more desperate hunter be impel when amid the chip of chew boat and the sink limb of tear comrade -PRON- swim out of the white curd of the whale 's direful wrath into the serene exasperating sunlight that smile on as if at a birth or a bridal
chapter_41	and then -PRON- be that suddenly sweep -PRON- sickle shape low jaw beneath -PRON- moby dick have reap away ahab 's leg as a mower a blade of grass in the field
chapter_41	yet without power to kill or change or shun the fact -PRON- likewise know that to mankind -PRON- do long dissemble in some sort do still
chapter_41	have any one of -PRON- old acquaintance on shore but half dream of what be lurk in -PRON- then how soon would -PRON- aghast and righteous soul have wrench the ship from such a fiendish man
chapter_42	aside from those more obvious consideration touch moby dick which could not but occasionally awaken in any man 's soul some alarm there be another thought or rather vague nameless horror concern -PRON- which at time by -PRON- intensity completely overpower all the rest and yet so mystical and well nigh ineffable be -PRON- that -PRON- almost despair of put -PRON- in a comprehensible form
chapter_42	this elusive quality -PRON- be which cause the thought of whiteness when divorce from more kindly association and couple with any object terrible in -PRON- to heighten that terror to the furth bound
chapter_42	that ghastly whiteness -PRON- be which impart such an abhorrent mildness even more loathsome than terrific to the dumb gloating of -PRON- aspect
chapter_42	with reference to the polar bear -PRON- may possibly be urge by -PRON- who would fain go still deep into this matter that -PRON- be not the whiteness separately regard which heighten the intolerable hideousness of that brute for analyse that heighten hideousness -PRON- may be say only rise from the circumstance that the irresponsible ferociousness of the creature stand invest in the fleece of celestial innocence and love and hence by bring together two such opposite emotion in -PRON- mind the polar bear frighten -PRON- with so unnatural a contrast
chapter_42	this peculiarity be most vividly hit by the french in the name -PRON- bestow upon that fish
chapter_42	the romish mass for the dead begin with requiem eternam eternal rest whence requiem denominate the mass -PRON- and any other funeral music
chapter_42	now in allusion to the white silent stillness of death in this shark and the mild deadliness of -PRON- habit the french call -PRON- requin
chapter_42	
chapter_42	wondrous fluttering and throbbing shake -PRON-
chapter_42	as abraham before the angel -PRON- bow -PRON- the white thing be so white -PRON- wing so wide and in those for ever exile water -PRON- have lose the miserable warp memory of tradition and of town
chapter_42	a goney -PRON- reply
chapter_42	for neither have -PRON- then read the rhyme nor know the bird to be an albatross
chapter_42	-PRON- assert then that in the wondrous bodily whiteness of the bird chiefly lurk the secret of the spell a truth the more evinced in this that by a solecism of term there be bird call grey albatross and these -PRON- have frequently see but never with such emotion as when -PRON- behold the antarctic fowl
chapter_42	whisper -PRON- not and -PRON- will tell with a treacherous hook and line as the fowl float on the sea
chapter_42	most famous in -PRON- western annal and indian tradition be that of the white steed of the prairies a magnificent milk white charger large eyed small head bluff chested and with the dignity of a thousand monarch in -PRON- lofty overscorn carriage
chapter_42	the flashing cascade of -PRON- mane the curve comet of -PRON- tail invest -PRON- with housing more resplendent than gold and silver beater could have furnish -PRON-
chapter_42	a most imperial and archangelical apparition of that unfallen western world which to the eye of the old trapper and hunter revive the glory of those primeval time when adam walk majestic as a god bluff browed and fearless as this mighty steed
chapter_42	-PRON- be that whiteness which invest -PRON- a thing express by the name -PRON- bear
chapter_42	the albino be as well make as other man have no substantive deformity and yet this mere aspect of all pervade whiteness make -PRON- more strangely hideous than the ugly abortion
chapter_42	why should this be so
chapter_42	nor in quite other aspect do nature in -PRON- least palpable but not the less malicious agency fail to enlist among -PRON- force this crowning attribute of the terrible
chapter_42	nor in some historic instance have the art of human malice omit so potent an auxiliary
chapter_42	how wildly -PRON- heighten the effect of that passage in froissart when mask in the snowy symbol of -PRON- faction the desperate white hoods of ghent murder -PRON- bailiff in the market place
chapter_42	and from that pallor of the dead -PRON- borrow the expressive hue of the shroud in which -PRON- wrap -PRON-
chapter_42	or to choose a wholly unsubstantial instance purely address to the fancy why in read the old fairy tale of central europe do the tall pale man of the hartz forest whose changeless pallor unrustlingly glide through the green of the grove why be this phantom more terrible than all the whoop imp of the blocksburg
chapter_42	for lima have take the white veil and there be a high horror in this whiteness of -PRON- woe
chapter_42	old as pizarro this whiteness keep -PRON- ruin for ever new admit not the cheerful greenness of complete decay spread over -PRON- break rampart the rigid pallor of an apoplexy that fix -PRON- own distortion
chapter_42	first the mariner when draw nigh the coast of foreign land if by night -PRON- hear the roar of breaker start to vigilance and feel just enough of trepidation to sharpen all -PRON- faculty but under precisely similar circumstance let -PRON- be call from -PRON- hammock to view -PRON- ship sail through a midnight sea of milky whiteness as if from encircle headland shoal of comb white bear be swim round -PRON- then -PRON- feel a silent superstitious dread the shrouded phantom of the whitened water be horrible to -PRON- as a real ghost in vain the lead assure -PRON- -PRON- be still off sounding heart and helm -PRON- both go down -PRON- never rest till blue water be under -PRON- again
chapter_42	but thou sayest methink that white lead chapter about whiteness be but a white flag hang out from a craven soul thou surrender to a hypo ishmael tell -PRON- why this strong young colt foal in some peaceful valley of vermont far remove from all beast of prey why be -PRON- that upon the sunny day if -PRON- but shake a fresh buffalo robe behind -PRON- so that -PRON- can not even see -PRON- but only smell -PRON- wild animal muskiness why will -PRON- start snort and with burst eye paw the ground in phrensie of affright
chapter_42	no but here thou beholdest even in a dumb brute the instinct of the knowledge of the demonism in the world

chapter_44	by that circular -PRON- appear that precisely such a chart be in course of completion and portion of -PRON- be present in the circular
chapter_44	
chapter_44	besides when make a passage from one feeding ground to another the sperm whale guide by some infallible instinct say rather secret intelligence from the deity mostly swim in vein as -PRON- be call continue -PRON- way along a give ocean line with such undeviating exactitude that no ship ever sail -PRON- course by any chart with one tithe of such marvellous precision
chapter_44	there be a circumstance which at first sight seem to entangle -PRON- delirious but still methodical scheme
chapter_44	though the gregarious sperm whale have -PRON- regular season for particular ground yet in general -PRON- can not conclude that the herd which haunt such and such a latitude or longitude this year say will turn out to be identically the same with those that be find there the precede season though there be peculiar and unquestionable instance where the contrary of this have prove true
chapter_44	but as the mind do not exist unless league with the soul therefore -PRON- must have be that in ahab 's case yield up all -PRON- thought and fancy to -PRON- one supreme purpose that purpose by -PRON- own sheer inveteracy of will force -PRON- against god and devil into a kind of self assume independent being of -PRON- own
chapter_44	nay could grimly live and burn while the common vitality to which -PRON- be conjoin flee horror stricken from the unbidden and unfathered birth
chapter_44	therefore the tormented spirit that glare out of bodily eye when what seem ahab rush from -PRON- room be for the time but a vacate thing a formless somnambulistic being a ray of living light to be sure but without an object to colour and therefore a blankness in -PRON-
chapter_45	in the instance where three year intervene between the flinging of the two harpoon and -PRON- think -PRON- may have be something more than that the man who dart -PRON- happen in the interval to go in a trading ship on a voyage to africa go ashore there join a discovery party and penetrate far into the interior where -PRON- travel for a period of nearly two year often endanger by serpent savage tiger poisonous miasma with all the other common peril incident to wander in the heart of unknown region
chapter_45	this man and this whale again come together and the one vanquish the other
chapter_45	in the three year instance -PRON- so fall out that -PRON- be in the boat both time first and last and the last time distinctly recognise a peculiar sort of huge mole under the whale 's eye which -PRON- have observe there three year previous
chapter_45	like some poor devil ashore that happen to know an irascible great man -PRON- make distant unobtrusive salutation to -PRON- in the street lest if -PRON- pursue the acquaintance further -PRON- may receive a summary thump for -PRON- presumption
chapter_45	thou terror of all cruiser that cross -PRON- wake in the vicinity of the tattoo land
chapter_45	thou chilian whale mark like an old tortoise with mystic hieroglyphic upon the back
chapter_45	new zealand tom and don miguel after at various time create great havoc among the boat of different vessel be finally go in quest of systematically hunt out chase and kill by valiant whaling captain who heave up -PRON- anchor with that express object as much in view as in set out through the narragansett woods captain butler of old have -PRON- in -PRON- mind to capture that notorious murderous savage annawon the headmost warrior of the indian king philip
chapter_45	for this be one of those disheartening instance where truth require full as much bolstering as error
chapter_45	for god 's sake be economical with -PRON- lamp and candle
chapter_45	
chapter_45	
chapter_45	the follow be extract from chace 's narrative every fact seem to warrant -PRON- in conclude that -PRON- be anything but chance which direct -PRON- operation -PRON- make two several attack upon the ship at a short interval between -PRON- both of which accord to -PRON- direction be calculate to do -PRON- the most injury by be make ahead and thereby combine the speed of the two object for the shock to effect which the exact manoeuvre which -PRON- make be necessary
chapter_45	the dark ocean and swell water be nothing the fear of be swallow up by some dreadful tempest or dash upon hidden rock with all the other ordinary subject of fearful contemplation seem scarcely entitle to a moment 's thought the dismal looking wreck and the horrid aspect and revenge of the whale wholly engross -PRON- reflection until day again make -PRON- appearance
chapter_45	45,--he speak of the mysterious and mortal attack of the animal
chapter_45	-PRON- will now refer -PRON- to langsdorff 's voyages for a little circumstance in point peculiarly interesting to the writer hereof
chapter_45	the ship however be by no mean a large one a russian craft build on the siberian coast and purchase by -PRON- uncle after barter away the vessel in which -PRON- sail from home
chapter_45	in the sixth christian century live procopius a christian magistrate of constantinople in the day when justinian be emperor and belisarius general
chapter_45	by the good authority -PRON- have always be consider a most trustworthy and unexaggerating historian except in some one or two particular not at all affect the matter presently to be mention
chapter_45	now in this history of -PRON- procopius mention that during the term of -PRON- prefecture at constantinople a great sea monster be capture in the neighbor propontis or sea of marmora after have destroy vessel at interval in those water for a period of more than fifty year
chapter_45	a fact thus set down in substantial history can not easily be gainsay
chapter_45	nor be there any reason -PRON- should be
chapter_45	of what precise specie this sea monster be be not mention
chapter_45	even now -PRON- be certain that those sea be not and perhaps never can be in the present constitution of thing a place for -PRON- habitual gregarious resort
chapter_45	but further investigation have recently prove to -PRON- that in modern time there have be isolated instance of the presence of the sperm whale in the mediterranean
chapter_45	if then -PRON- properly put these statement together and reason upon -PRON- a bit -PRON- will clearly perceive that accord to all human reasoning procopius 's sea monster that for half a century stove the ship of a roman emperor must in all probability have be a sperm whale
chapter_46	or at least if this be otherwise there be not want other motif much more influential with -PRON-
chapter_46	not only that but the subtle insanity of ahab respect moby dick be noway more significantly manifest than in -PRON- superlative sense and shrewdness in foresee that for the present the hunt should in some way be strip of that strange imaginative impiousness which naturally invest -PRON- that the full terror of the voyage must be keep withdraw into the obscure background for few man 's courage be proof against protracted meditation unrelieved by action that when -PRON- stand -PRON- long night watch -PRON- officer and man must have some nearer thing to think of than moby dick
chapter_46	for however eagerly and impetuously the savage crew have hail the announcement of -PRON- quest yet all sailor of all sort be more or less capricious and unreliable -PRON- live in the vary outer weather and -PRON- inhale -PRON- fickleness and when retain for any object remote and blank in the pursuit however promissory of life and passion in the end -PRON- be above all thing requisite that temporary interest and employment should intervene and hold -PRON- healthily suspend for the final dash
chapter_46	the permanent constitutional condition of the manufactured man think ahab be sordidness
chapter_46	-PRON- be strictly hold to -PRON- one final and romantic object that final and romantic object too many would have turn from in disgust
chapter_46	-PRON- may scorn cash now but let some month go by and no perspective promise of -PRON- to -PRON- and then this same quiescent cash all at once mutiny in -PRON- this same cash would soon cashier
chapter_46	from even the barely hint imputation of usurpation and the possible consequence of such a suppress impression gain ground ahab must of course have be most anxious to protect -PRON-
chapter_47	there -PRON- blow there there
chapter_47	there
chapter_47	on the lee beam about two mile off
chapter_47	the sperm whale blow as a clock tick with the same undeviating and reliable uniformity
chapter_47	quick steward cry ahab
chapter_47	time time
chapter_47	one of the man select for shipkeeper that is those not appoint to the boat by this time relieve the indian at the main mast head
chapter_47	so look the long line of man of war 's man about to throw -PRON- on board an enemy 's ship
chapter_48	the first lowering
chapter_48	while yet the wondering ship 's company be gaze upon these stranger ahab cry out to the white turbaned old man at -PRON- head all ready there fedallah
chapter_48	ready be the half hissed reply
chapter_48	such be the thunder of -PRON- voice that spite of -PRON- amazement the man spring over the rail the sheaf whirl round in the block with a wallow the three boat drop into the sea while with a dexterous off handed daring unknown in any other vocation the sailor goat like leap down the rolling ship 's side into the toss boat below
chapter_48	hardly have -PRON- pull out from under the ship 's lee when a fourth keel come from the windward side pull round under the stern and show the five stranger row ahab who stand erect in the stern loudly hail starbuck stubb and flask to spread -PRON- widely so as to cover a large expanse of water
chapter_48	never heed yonder yellow boy archy
chapter_48	and do not -PRON- tell cabaco here of -PRON-
chapter_48	what say ye cabaco
chapter_48	
chapter_48	why do not -PRON- break -PRON- backbone -PRON- boy
chapter_48	-PRON- be only five more hand come to help -PRON- never mind from where the more the merry
chapter_48	pull then do pull never mind the brimstone devil be good fellow enough
chapter_48	long and strong
chapter_48	the devil fetch ye ye ragamuffin rapscallion ye be all asleep
chapter_48	stop snore ye sleeper and pull
chapter_48	pull will not ye
chapter_48	stubb 's exordium to -PRON- crew be give here at large because -PRON- have rather a peculiar way of talk to -PRON- in general and especially in inculcate the religion of rowing
chapter_48	-PRON- would say the most terrific thing to -PRON- crew in a tone so strangely compound of fun and fury and the fury seem so calculate merely as a spice to the fun that no oarsman could hear such queer invocation without pull for dear life and yet pull for the mere joke of the thing
chapter_48	besides -PRON- all the time look so easy and indolent -PRON- so loungingly manage -PRON- steering oar and so broadly gaped open mouthed at time that the mere sight of such a yawn commander by sheer force of contrast act like a charm upon the crew
chapter_48	smuggle on board somehow before the ship sail
chapter_48	in a whisper to -PRON- crew then speak out loud again a sad business mr. stubb
chapter_48	this at least be duty duty and profit hand in hand
chapter_48	can not be help
chapter_48	-PRON- take off the extreme edge of -PRON- wonder and so what with all this and stubb 's confident way of account for -PRON- appearance -PRON- be for the time free from superstitious surmising though the affair still leave abundant room for all manner of wild conjecture as to dark ahab 's precise agency in the matter from the beginning
chapter_48	boat and crew sit motionless on the sea
chapter_48	every man look out along -PRON- oar cry starbuck
chapter_48	likewise upon the extreme stern of the boat where -PRON- be also triangularly platformed level with the gunwale starbuck -PRON- be see coolly and adroitly balance -PRON- to the jerking tossing of -PRON- chip of a craft and silently eye the vast blue eye of the sea
chapter_48	good a mast head as any sir
chapter_48	will -PRON- mount
chapter_48	that -PRON- will and thank ye very much -PRON- fine fellow only -PRON- wish -PRON- fifty foot tall
chapter_48	at any time -PRON- be a strange sight to the tyro to see with what wondrous habitude of unconscious skill the whaleman will maintain an erect posture in -PRON- boat even when pitch about by the most riotously perverse and cross run sea
chapter_48	meanwhile stubb the third mate betray no such far gaze solicitude
chapter_48	down down all and give way!--there -PRON- be
chapter_48	but -PRON- bid fair to outstrip -PRON- -PRON- fly on and on as a mass of interblend bubble bear down a rapid stream from the hill
chapter_48	pull pull -PRON- good boy say starbuck in the low possible but intensest concentrated whisper to -PRON- man while the sharp fix glance from -PRON- eye dart straight ahead of the bow almost seem as two visible needle in two unerring binnacle compass
chapter_48	sing out and say something -PRON- heartie
chapter_48	lie -PRON- on lie -PRON- on
chapter_48	o lord lord
chapter_48	yes give -PRON- fit that be the very word pitch fit into -PRON-
chapter_48	but what the devil be -PRON- hurry about
chapter_48	only pull and keep pull nothing more
chapter_48	that be all
chapter_48	the repeat specific allusion of flask to that whale as -PRON- call the fictitious monster which -PRON- declare to be incessantly tantalize -PRON- boat 's bow with -PRON- tail these allusion of -PRON- be at time so vivid and life like that -PRON- would because some one or two of -PRON- man to snatch a fearful look over the shoulder
chapter_48	-PRON- sail be now set and with the still rise wind -PRON- rush along the boat go with such madness through the water that the lee oar could scarcely be work rapidly enough to escape be tear from the row lock
chapter_48	soon -PRON- be run through a suffuse wide veil of mist neither ship nor boat to be see
chapter_48	and queequeg harpoon in hand spring to -PRON- foot
chapter_48	the wind increase to a howl the wave dash -PRON- buckler together the whole squall roar fork and crackle around -PRON- like a white fire upon the prairie in which unconsumed -PRON- be burning immortal in these jaw of death
chapter_48	in vain -PRON- hail the other boat as well roar to the live coal down the chimney of a flaming furnace as hail those boat in that storm
chapter_48	suddenly queequeg start to -PRON- foot hollow -PRON- hand to -PRON- ear
chapter_48	-PRON- all hear a faint creaking as of rope and yard hitherto muffle by the storm
chapter_48	float on the wave -PRON- see the abandon boat as for one instant -PRON- toss and gap beneath the ship 's bow like a chip at the base of a cataract and then the vast hull roll over -PRON- and -PRON- be see no more till -PRON- come up welter astern
chapter_49	the hyena
chapter_49	there be certain queer time and occasion in this strange mixed affair -PRON- call life when a man take this whole universe for a vast practical joke though the wit thereof -PRON- but dimly discern and more than suspect that the joke be at nobody 's expense but -PRON- own
chapter_49	and as for small difficulty and worrying prospect of sudden disaster peril of life and limb all these and death -PRON- seem to -PRON- only sly good natured hit and jolly punch in the side bestow by the unseen and unaccountable old joker
chapter_49	-PRON- should like to see a boat 's crew backing water up to a whale face foremost
chapter_49	here then from three impartial witness -PRON- have a deliberate statement of the entire case
chapter_50	if -PRON- leg be off at the hip now -PRON- would be a different thing
chapter_50	ahab well know that although -PRON- friend at home would think little of -PRON- enter a boat in certain comparatively harmless vicissitude of the chase for the sake of be near the scene of action and give -PRON- order in person yet for captain ahab to have a boat actually apportion to -PRON- as a regular headsman in the hunt above all for captain ahab to be supply with five extra man as that same boat 's crew -PRON- well know that such generous conceit never enter the head of the owner of the pequod
chapter_51	for of these moonlight night -PRON- be -PRON- will not to mount to the main mast head and stand a look out there with the same precision as if -PRON- have be day
chapter_51	and yet though herd of whale be see by night not one whaleman in a hundred would venture a lowering for -PRON-
chapter_51	for though -PRON- be a most unwonted hour yet so impressive be the cry and so deliriously exciting that almost every soul on board instinctively desire a lowering
chapter_51	the good man in the ship must take the helm
chapter_51	then with every mast head man the pile up craft roll down before the wind
chapter_51	the strange upheaving lift tendency of the taffrail breeze fill the hollow of so many sail make the buoyant hover deck to feel like air beneath the foot while still -PRON- rush along as if two antagonistic influence be struggle in -PRON- one to mount direct to heaven the other to drive yawingly to some horizontal goal
chapter_51	and so -PRON- serve -PRON- night after night till no one heed -PRON- but to wonder at -PRON-
chapter_51	nor with the immemorial superstition of -PRON- race and in accordance with the preternaturalness as -PRON- seem which in many thing invest the pequod be there want some of the seaman who swear that whenever and wherever descry at however remote time or in however far apart latitude and longitude that unnearable spout be cast by one self same whale and that whale moby dick
chapter_51	cape of good hope do -PRON- call ye
chapter_51	in tempestuous time like these after everything above and aloft have be secure nothing more can be do but passively to await the issue of the gale
chapter_51	few or no word be speak and the silent ship as if man by paint sailor in wax day after day tear on through all the swift madness and gladness of the demoniac wave
chapter_51	by night the same muteness of humanity before the shriek of the ocean prevail still in silence the man swing in the bowline still wordless ahab stand up to the blast
chapter_51	never could starbuck forget the old man 's aspect when one night go down into the cabin to mark how the barometer stand -PRON- see -PRON- with closed eye sit straight in -PRON- floor screw chair the rain and half melt sleet of the storm from which -PRON- have some time before emerge still slowly drip from the unremoved hat and coat
chapter_51	-PRON- lantern swing from -PRON- tightly clench hand
chapter_51	
chapter_51	the cabin compass be call the tell tale because without go to the compass at the helm the captain while below can inform -PRON- of the course of the ship
chapter_52	as if the wave have be fuller this craft be bleach like the skeleton of a strand walrus
chapter_52	have ye see the white whale
chapter_52	and this time three year if -PRON- be not at home tell -PRON- to address -PRON- to--
chapter_52	though in the course of -PRON- continual voyaging ahab must often before have notice a similar sight yet to any monomaniac man the veri trifle capriciously carry meaning
chapter_52	keep -PRON- off round the world
chapter_53	besides -PRON- would exchange the whaling news and have an agreeable chat
chapter_53	for not only would -PRON- meet with all the sympathy of sailor but likewise with all the peculiar congeniality arise from a common pursuit and mutually share privation and peril
chapter_53	besides the english whaler sometimes affect a kind of metropolitan superiority over the american whaler regard the long lean nantucketer with -PRON- nondescript provincialism as a sort of sea peasant
chapter_53	but this be a harmless little foible in the english whale hunter which the nantucketer do not take much to heart probably because -PRON- know that -PRON- have a few foible -PRON-
chapter_53	whereas some merchant ship cross each other 's wake in the mid atlantic will oftentimes pass on without so much as a single word of recognition mutually cut each other on the high sea like a brace of dandy in broadway and all the time indulge perhaps in finical criticism upon each other 's rig
chapter_53	as for men of war when -PRON- chance to meet at sea -PRON- first go through such a string of silly bowing and scraping such a ducking of ensign that there do not seem to be much right down hearty good will and brotherly love about -PRON- at all
chapter_53	what do the whaler do when -PRON- meet another whaler in any sort of decent weather
chapter_53	-PRON- may wear out -PRON- index finger run up and down the column of dictionary and never find the word
chapter_53	but the whale boat have no seat astern no sofa of that sort whatev and no tiller at all
chapter_53	nor be this any very easy matter for in -PRON- rear be the immense project steering oar hit -PRON- now and then in the small of -PRON- back the after oar reciprocate by rap -PRON- knee in front
chapter_53	nevertheless there have occur instance well authenticate one too where the captain have be know for an uncommonly critical moment or two in a sudden squall say to seize hold of the near oarsman 's hair and hold on there like grim death
chapter_54	-PRON- be man almost wholly by polynesians
chapter_54	in the short gam that ensue -PRON- give -PRON- strong news of moby dick
chapter_54	to some the general interest in the white whale be now wildly heighten by a circumstance of the town ho 's story which seem obscurely to involve with the whale a certain wondrous inverted visitation of one of those so call judgment of god which at time be say to overtake some man
chapter_54	this latter circumstance with -PRON- own particular accompaniment form what may be call the secret part of the tragedy about to be narrate never reach the ear of captain ahab or -PRON- mate
chapter_54	nevertheless so potent an influence do this thing have on those seaman in the pequod who come to the full knowledge of -PRON- and by such a strange delicacy to call -PRON- so be -PRON- govern in this matter that -PRON- keep the secret among -PRON- so that -PRON- never transpire abaft the pequod 's main mast
chapter_54	for -PRON- humor 's sake -PRON- shall preserve the style in which -PRON- once narrate -PRON- at lima to a lounge circle of -PRON- spanish friend one saint 's eve smoke upon the thick gilt tile piazza of the golden inn
chapter_54	some two year prior to -PRON- first learn the event which -PRON- be about rehearse to -PRON- gentleman the town ho sperm whaler of nantucket be cruise in -PRON- pacific here not very many day sail eastward from the eaf of this good golden inn
chapter_54	one morning upon handle the pump accord to daily usage -PRON- be observe that -PRON- make more water in -PRON- hold than common
chapter_54	-PRON- suppose a sword fish have stab -PRON- gentleman
chapter_54	but the captain have some unusual reason for believe that rare good luck await -PRON- in those latitude and therefore be very averse to quit -PRON- and the leak not be then consider at all dangerous though indeed -PRON- could not find -PRON- after search the hold as low down as be possible in rather heavy weather the ship still continue -PRON- cruising the mariner work at the pump at wide and easy interval but no good luck come more day go by and not only be the leak yet undiscovered but -PRON- sensibly increase
chapter_54	so much so that now take some alarm the captain make all sail stand away for the near harbor among the island there to have -PRON- hull hove out and repair
chapter_54	pray what be a lakeman and where be buffalo
chapter_54	say don sebastian rise in -PRON- swinging mat of grass
chapter_54	-PRON- contain round archipelago of romantic isle even as the polynesian water do in large part be shore by two great contrast nation as the atlantic be -PRON- furnish long maritime approach to -PRON- numerous territorial colony from the east dot all round -PRON- bank here and there be frown upon by battery and by the goat like craggy gun of lofty mackinaw -PRON- have hear the fleet thundering of naval victory at interval -PRON- yield -PRON- beach to wild barbarian whose red paint face flash from out -PRON- peltry wigwam for league and league be flank by ancient and unentered forest where the gaunt pine stand like serried line of king in gothic genealogy those same wood harbor wild afric beast of prey and silken creature whose export fur give robe to tartar emperors -PRON- mirror the paved capital of buffalo and cleveland as well as winnebago village -PRON- float alike the full rig merchant ship the armed cruiser of the state the steamer and the beech canoe -PRON- be sweep by borean and dismasting blast as direful as any that lash the salt wave -PRON- know what shipwreck be for out of sight of land however inland -PRON- have drown full many a midnight ship with all -PRON- shriek crew
chapter_54	thus gentleman though an inlander steelkilt be wild ocean bear and wild ocean nurture as much of an audacious mariner as any
chapter_54	and for radney though in -PRON- infancy -PRON- may have lay -PRON- down on the lone nantucket beach to nurse at -PRON- maternal sea though in after life -PRON- have long follow -PRON- austere atlantic and -PRON- contemplative pacific yet be -PRON- quite as vengeful and full of social quarrel as the backwoods seaman fresh from the latitude of buck horn handle bowie knife
chapter_54	at all event -PRON- have prove so thus far but radney be doom and make mad and steelkilt but gentleman -PRON- shall hear
chapter_54	so when -PRON- be work that evening at the pump there be on this head no small gamesomeness slily go on among -PRON- as -PRON- stand with -PRON- foot continually overflow by the ripple clear water clear as any mountain spring gentleman that bubble from the pump run across the deck and pour -PRON- out in steady spout at the lee scupper hole
chapter_54	but radney the mate be ugly as a mule yet as hardy as stubborn as malicious
chapter_54	-PRON- tell ye what man old rad 's investment must go for -PRON-
chapter_54	-PRON- have best cut away -PRON- part of the hull and tow -PRON- home
chapter_54	boy -PRON- say the rest of -PRON- property be invest in look glass
chapter_54	-PRON- wonder if -PRON- would give a poor devil like -PRON- the model of -PRON- nose
chapter_54	roar radney pretend not to have hear the sailor talk
chapter_54	but so -PRON- happen
chapter_54	intolerably stride along the deck the mate command -PRON- to get a broom and sweep down the plank and also a shovel and remove some offensive matter consequent upon allow a pig to run at large now gentleman sweep a ship 's deck at sea be a piece of household work which in all time but rag gale be regularly attend to every evening -PRON- have be know to be do in the case of ship actually founder at the time
chapter_54	such gentleman be the inflexibility of sea usage and the instinctive love of neatness in seaman some of whom would not willingly drown without first washing -PRON- face
chapter_54	-PRON- mention all these particular so that -PRON- may understand exactly how this affair stand between the two man
chapter_54	but there be more than this the order about the shovel be almost as plainly mean to sting and insult steelkilt as though radney have spat in -PRON- face
chapter_54	but as -PRON- sit still for a moment and as -PRON- steadfastly look into the mate 's malignant eye and perceive the stack of powder cask heap up in -PRON- and the slow match silently burn along towards -PRON- as -PRON- instinctively see all this that strange forbearance and unwillingness to stir up the deep passionateness in any already ireful being a repugnance most feel when feel at all by really valiant man even when aggrieved this nameless phantom feeling gentleman steal over steelkilt
chapter_54	therefore in -PRON- ordinary tone only a little break by the bodily exhaustion -PRON- be temporarily in -PRON- answer -PRON- say that sweep the deck be not -PRON- business and -PRON- would not do -PRON-
chapter_54	to this radney reply with an oath in a most domineering and outrageous manner unconditionally reiterate -PRON- command meanwhile advance upon the still seat lakeman with an uplifted cooper 's club hammer which -PRON- have snatch from a cask near by
chapter_54	heated and irritated as -PRON- be by -PRON- spasmodic toil at the pump for all -PRON- first nameless feeling of forbearance the sweating steelkilt could but ill brook this bearing in the mate but somehow still smother the conflagration within -PRON- without speak -PRON- remain doggedly rooted to -PRON- seat till at last the incensed radney shake the hammer within a few inch of -PRON- face furiously command -PRON- to do -PRON- bidding
chapter_54	but the predestinate mate come still closer to -PRON- where the lakeman stand fix now shake the heavy hammer within an inch of -PRON- tooth meanwhile repeat a string of insufferable malediction
chapter_54	canallers cry don pedro
chapter_54	aye
chapter_54	well then don refill -PRON- cup
chapter_54	for by some curious fatality as -PRON- be often note of -PRON- metropolitan freebooter that -PRON- ever encamp around the hall of justice so sinner gentleman most abound in holy vicinity
chapter_54	in the name of all -PRON- limeese -PRON- but desire to express to -PRON- sir sailor that -PRON- have by no mean overlook -PRON- delicacy in not substitute present lima for distant venice in -PRON- corrupt comparison
chapter_54	like mark antony for day and day along -PRON- green turf flowery nile -PRON- indolently float openly toy with -PRON- red cheeked cleopatra ripen -PRON- apricot thigh upon the sunny deck
chapter_54	a terror to the smile innocence of the village through which -PRON- float -PRON- swart visage and bold swagger be not unshunn in city
chapter_54	-PRON- see
chapter_54	impetuously exclaim don pedro spill -PRON- chicha upon -PRON- silvery ruffle
chapter_54	the world 's one lima
chapter_54	but the story -PRON- leave off gentleman where the lakeman shake the backstay
chapter_54	but slide down the rope like baleful comet the two canallers rush into the uproar and seek to drag -PRON- man out of -PRON- towards the forecastle
chapter_54	other of the sailor join with -PRON- in this attempt and a twisted turmoil ensue while stand out of harm 's way the valiant captain dance up and down with a whale pike call upon -PRON- officer to manhandle that atrocious scoundrel and smoke -PRON- along to the quarter deck
chapter_54	but steelkilt and -PRON- desperado be too much for -PRON- all -PRON- succeed in gain the forecastle deck where hastily slew about three or four large cask in a line with the windlass these sea parisians entrench -PRON- behind the barricade
chapter_54	roar the captain now menace -PRON- with a pistol in each hand just bring to -PRON- by the steward
chapter_54	come out of that ye cut throat
chapter_54	turn to turn to!--i make no promise to -PRON- duty
chapter_54	turn to
chapter_54	and -PRON- once more raise a pistol
chapter_54	aye let -PRON- sink
chapter_54	there be a few of -PRON- here and -PRON- be one of -PRON- who have ship for the cruise d'ye see now as -PRON- well know sir -PRON- can claim -PRON- discharge as soon as the anchor be down so -PRON- do not want a row -PRON- be not -PRON- interest -PRON- want to be peaceable -PRON- be ready to work but -PRON- will not be flog
chapter_54	steelkilt glance round -PRON- a moment and then said:--'i tell -PRON- what -PRON- be now captain rather than kill ye and be hang for such a shabby rascal -PRON- will not lift a hand against ye unless ye attack -PRON- but till -PRON- say the word about not flog -PRON- -PRON- do not do a hand 's turn down into the forecastle then down with ye -PRON- will keep ye there till ye're sick of -PRON-
chapter_54	as the lakeman 's bare head be just level with the plank the captain and -PRON- posse leap the barricade and rapidly draw over the slide of the scuttle plant -PRON- group of hand upon -PRON- and loudly call for the steward to bring the heavy brass padlock belong to the companionway
chapter_54	on the fifth morning three other of the mutineer bolt up into the air from the desperate arm below that seek to restrain -PRON-
chapter_54	that be the last night -PRON- should spend in that den
chapter_54	in a few minute the scuttle be open and bind hand and foot the still struggle ringleader be shove up into the air by -PRON- perfidious ally who at once claim the honour of secure a man who have be fully ripe for murder
chapter_54	at sunrise -PRON- summon all hand and separate those who have rebel from those who have take no part in the mutiny -PRON- tell the former that -PRON- have a good mind to flog -PRON- all round think upon the whole -PRON- would do so -PRON- ought to
chapter_54	justice demand -PRON- but for the present consider -PRON- timely surrender -PRON- would let -PRON- go with a reprimand which -PRON- accordingly administer in the vernacular
chapter_54	take that gag from -PRON- mouth and let -PRON- hear what -PRON- can say for -PRON-
chapter_54	still no sign of mutiny reappear among the rest
chapter_54	but in order to insure the speedy end to the voyage -PRON- all agree to another thing namely not to sing out for whale in case any should be discover
chapter_54	in this attitude -PRON- be well know -PRON- sometimes doze
chapter_54	steelkilt calculate -PRON- time and find that -PRON- next trick at the helm would come round at two o'clock in the morning of the third day from that in which -PRON- have be betray
chapter_54	what be -PRON- make there
chapter_54	yes rather oddish say the lakeman hold -PRON- at arm 's length before -PRON-
chapter_54	but gentleman a fool save the would be murderer from the bloody deed -PRON- have plan
chapter_54	jesu what a whale
chapter_54	-PRON- be moby dick moby dick
chapter_54	sir sailor but do whale have christening
chapter_54	whom call -PRON- moby dick
chapter_54	a very white and famous and most deadly immortal monster don but that would be too long a story
chapter_54	
chapter_54	nay nay
chapter_54	the chicha cry don pedro -PRON- vigorous friend look faint fill up -PRON- empty glass
chapter_54	now gentleman so suddenly perceive the snowy whale within fifty yard of the ship forgetful of the compact among the crew in the excitement of the moment the teneriffe man have instinctively and involuntarily lift -PRON- voice for the monster though for some little time past -PRON- have be plainly behold from the three sullen mast head
chapter_54	and now -PRON- bandage cry be to beach -PRON- on the whale 's topmost back
chapter_54	that instant as -PRON- fall on the whale 's slippery back the boat right and be dash aside by the swell while radney be toss over into the sea on the other flank of the whale
chapter_54	but the whale rush round in a sudden maelstrom seize the swimmer between -PRON- jaw and rear high up with -PRON- plunge headlong again and go down
chapter_54	all four boat give chase again but the whale elude -PRON- and finally wholly disappear
chapter_54	after take counsel with -PRON- officer -PRON- anchor the ship as far off shore as possible loaded and run out -PRON- two cannon from the bow stack -PRON- musket on the poop and warn the islanders not to approach the ship at -PRON- peril take one man with -PRON- and set the sail of -PRON- good whale boat steer straight before the wind for tahiti five hundred mile distant to procure a reinforcement to -PRON- crew
chapter_54	the captain present a pistol
chapter_54	with one foot on each prow of the yoke war canoe the lakeman laugh -PRON- to scorn assure -PRON- that if the pistol so much as click in the lock -PRON- would bury -PRON- in bubble and foam what do -PRON- want of -PRON-
chapter_54	and for what be -PRON- bind demand steelkilt no lie
chapter_54	with that -PRON- leap from the canoe swim to the boat and climb the gunwale stand face to face with the captain
chapter_54	-PRON- swim back to -PRON- comrade
chapter_54	some ten day after the french ship sail the whale boat arrive and the captain be force to enlist some of the more civilized tahitians who have be somewhat use to the sea
chapter_54	but -PRON- know a worthy priest near by who will quickly procure one for -PRON-
chapter_54	-PRON- go for -PRON- but be -PRON- well advise
chapter_54	
chapter_54	-PRON- know -PRON- to be true -PRON- happen on this ball -PRON- tread the ship -PRON- know the crew -PRON- have see and talk with steelkilt since the death of radney
chapter_55	-PRON- be time to set the world right in this matter by prove such picture of the whale all wrong
chapter_55	-PRON- may be that the primal source of all those pictorial delusion will be find among the old hindoo egyptian and grecian sculpture
chapter_55	no wonder then that in some sort -PRON- noble profession of whaling should have be there shadow forth
chapter_55	the hindoo whale refer to occur in a separate department of the wall depict the incarnation of vishnu in the form of leviathan learnedly know as the matse avatar
chapter_55	but go to the old galleries and look now at a great christian painter 's portrait of this fish for -PRON- succeed no good than the antediluvian hindoo
chapter_55	where do guido get the model of such a strange creature as that
chapter_55	the huge corpulence of that hogarthian monster undulate on the surface scarcely draw one inch of water
chapter_55	then there be the prodromus whale of old scotch sibbald and jonah 's whale as depict in the print of old bible and the cut of old primer
chapter_55	then again there be an impose quarto write by one captain colnett a post captain in the english navy entitle a voyage round cape horn into the south seas for the purpose of extend the spermaceti whale fisheries
chapter_55	-PRON- do not wish to seem inelegant but this unsightly whale look much like an amputate sow and as for the narwhale one glimpse at -PRON- be enough to amaze one that in this nineteenth century such a hippogriff could be palm for genuine upon any intelligent public of schoolboy
chapter_55	all
chapter_55	but the placing of the cap sheaf to all this blunder business be reserve for the scientific frederick cuvier brother to the famous baron
chapter_55	in 1836 -PRON- publish a natural history of whales in which -PRON- give what -PRON- call a picture of the sperm whale
chapter_55	before show that picture to any nantucketer -PRON- have best provide for -PRON- summary retreat from nantucket
chapter_55	in a word frederick cuvier 's sperm whale be not a sperm whale but a squash
chapter_55	of course -PRON- never have the benefit of a whaling voyage such man seldom have but whence -PRON- derive that picture who can tell
chapter_55	not at all
chapter_55	for -PRON- be one of the more curious thing about this leviathan that -PRON- skeleton give very little idea of -PRON- general shape
chapter_55	but all these be permanently lodge in -PRON- fleshy covering as the human finger in an artificial covering
chapter_55	
chapter_56	in the previous chapter colnett and cuvier have be refer to
chapter_56	the action of the whole thing be wonderfully good and true
chapter_56	the half empty line tub float on the whitened sea the wooden pole of the spill harpoon obliquely bob in -PRON- the head of the swimming crew be scatter about the whale in contrast expression of affright while in the black stormy distance the ship be bear down upon the scene
chapter_56	sea fowl be peck at the small crab shell fish and other sea candy and maccaroni which the right whale sometimes carry on -PRON- pestilent back
chapter_56	thus the foreground be all rag commotion but behind in admirable artistic contrast be the glassy level of a sea becalm the drooping unstarched sail of the powerless ship and the inert mass of a dead whale a conquered fortress with the flag of capture lazily hang from the whale pole insert into -PRON- spout hole
chapter_56	but -PRON- life for -PRON- -PRON- be either practically conversant with -PRON- subject or else marvellously tutor by some experienced whaleman
chapter_56	the french be the lad for paint action
chapter_56	the natural aptitude of the french for seize the picturesqueness of thing seem to be peculiarly evince in what painting and engraving -PRON- have of -PRON- whaling scene
chapter_56	one of -PRON- though not precisely adapt to -PRON- present purpose nevertheless deserve mention on other account
chapter_57	but the time of -PRON- justification have now come
chapter_57	-PRON- three whale be as good whale as be ever publish in wapping at any rate and -PRON- stump as unquestionable a stump as any -PRON- will find in the western clearing
chapter_57	but though for ever mount on that stump never a stump speech do the poor whaleman make but with downcast eye stand ruefully contemplate -PRON- own amputation
chapter_57	-PRON- -PRON- be a savage own no allegiance but to the king of the cannibals and ready at any moment to rebel against -PRON-
chapter_57	some of -PRON- be do with much accuracy
chapter_57	when the porter be sleepy the anvil head whale would be good
chapter_57	nor when expandingly lift by -PRON- subject can -PRON- fail to trace out great whale in the starry heaven and boat in pursuit of -PRON- as when long fill with thought of war the eastern nation see army lock in battle among the cloud
chapter_57	with a frigate 's anchor for -PRON- bridle bitt and fasce of harpoon for spur would -PRON- could mount that whale and leap the topmost sky to see whether the fabled heaven with all -PRON- countless tent really lie encamp beyond -PRON- mortal sight
chapter_58	for league and league -PRON- undulate round -PRON- so that -PRON- seem to be sail through boundless field of ripe and golden wheat
chapter_58	
chapter_58	no mercy no power but -PRON- own control -PRON-
chapter_58	god keep thee
chapter_59	but one transparent blue morning when a stillness almost preternatural spread over the sea however unattend with any stagnant calm when the long burnish sun glade on the water seem a golden finger lay across -PRON- enjoin some secrecy when the slipper wave whisper together as -PRON- softly run on in this profound hush of the visible sphere a strange spectre be see by daggoo from the main mast head
chapter_59	in the distance a great white mass lazily rise and rise high and high and disentangle -PRON- from the azure at last gleamed before -PRON- prow like a snow slide new slide from the hill
chapter_59	bare head in the sultry sun ahab stand on the bowsprit and with one hand push far behind in readiness to wave -PRON- order to the helmsman cast -PRON- eager glance in the direction indicate aloft by the outstretched motionless arm of daggoo
chapter_59	almost forget for the moment all thought of moby dick -PRON- now gaze at the most wondrous phenomenon which the secret sea have hitherto reveal to mankind
chapter_59	a vast pulpy mass furlong in length and breadth of a glance cream colour lie float on the water innumerable long arm radiate from -PRON- centre and curl and twist like a nest of anaconda as if blindly to clutch at any hapless object within reach
chapter_59	"as with a low suck sound -PRON- slowly disappear again starbuck still gaze at the agitated water where -PRON- have sink with a wild voice exclaimed--""almost rather have -PRON- see moby dick and fight -PRON- than to have see thee thou white ghost"
chapter_59	for though other specie of whale find -PRON- food above water and may be see by man in the act of feeding the spermaceti whale obtain -PRON- whole food in unknown zone below the surface and only by inference be -PRON- that any one can tell of what precisely that food consist
chapter_60	but so as to form one round cheese shape mass of densely bed sheaf or layer of concentric spiralization without any hollow
chapter_60	both end of the line be expose the low end terminate in an eye splice or loop come up from the bottom against the side of the tub and hang over -PRON- edge completely disengage from everything
chapter_60	this arrangement of the low end be necessary on two account
chapter_60	thus the whale line fold the whole boat in -PRON- complicated coil twisting and writhe around -PRON- in almost every direction
chapter_60	all the oarsman be involve in -PRON- perilous contortion so that to the timid eye of the landsman -PRON- seem as indian juggler with the deadly snake sportively festoon -PRON- limb
chapter_60	nor can any son of mortal woman for the first time seat -PRON- amid those hempen intricacy and while strain -PRON- utmost at the oar bethink -PRON- that at any unknown instant the harpoon may be dart and all these horrible contortion be put in play like ringed lightning -PRON- can not be thus circumstanc without a shudder that make the very marrow in -PRON- bone to quiver in -PRON- like a shake jelly
chapter_60	gay sally more merry mirth good joke and bright repartee -PRON- never hear over -PRON- mahogany than -PRON- will hear over the half inch white cedar of the whale boat when thus hang in hangman 's noose and like the six burgher of calais before king edward the six man compose the crew pull into the jaw of death with a halter around every neck as -PRON- may say
chapter_60	but why say more
chapter_60	all be bear with halter round -PRON- neck but -PRON- be only when catch in the swift sudden turn of death that mortal realize the silent subtle ever present peril of life
chapter_61	when -PRON- see -PRON- quid say the savage hone -PRON- harpoon in the bow of -PRON- hoist boat then -PRON- quick see -PRON- parm whale
chapter_61	-PRON- be -PRON- turn to stand at the foremast head and with -PRON- shoulder lean against the slacken royal shroud to and fro -PRON- idly sway in what seem an enchanted air
chapter_61	suddenly bubble seem burst beneath -PRON- closed eye like vice -PRON- hand grasp the shroud some invisible gracious agency preserve -PRON- with a shock -PRON- come back to life
chapter_61	as if strike by some enchanter 's wand the sleepy ship and every sleeper in -PRON- all at once start into wakefulness and more than a score of voice from all part of the vessel simultaneously with the three note from aloft shout forth the accustomed cry as the great fish slowly and regularly spout the sparkle brine into the air
chapter_61	there go fluke
chapter_61	yes a mighty change have come over the fish
chapter_61	all alive to -PRON- jeopardy -PRON- be go head out that part obliquely project from the mad yeast which -PRON- brew
chapter_61	though apparently the most massive -PRON- be by far the most buoyant part about -PRON-
chapter_61	so that with ease -PRON- elevate -PRON- in the air and invariably do so when go at -PRON- utmost speed
chapter_61	do not hurry yourself take plenty of time but start -PRON- start -PRON- like thunder clap that be all cry stubb splutter out the smoke as -PRON- speak
chapter_61	start -PRON- now give -PRON- the long and strong stroke tashtego
chapter_61	woo hoo
chapter_61	but -PRON- wild scream be answer by other quite as wild
chapter_61	kee hee
chapter_61	ka la
chapter_61	as the line pass round and round the loggerhead so also just before reach that point -PRON- blisteringly pass through and through both of stubb 's hand from which the hand cloth or square of quilted canvas sometimes wear at these time have accidentally drop
chapter_61	-PRON- be like hold an enemy 's sharp two edge sword by the blade and that enemy all the time strive to wrest -PRON- out of -PRON- clutch
chapter_61	haul in haul in cry stubb to the bowsman
chapter_61	and face round towards the whale all hand begin pull the boat up to -PRON- while yet the boat be be tow on
chapter_61	soon range up by -PRON- flank stubb firmly plant -PRON- knee in the clumsy cleat dart dart after dart into the fly fish at the word of command the boat alternately stern out of the way of the whale 's horrible wallow and then range up for another fling
chapter_61	the red tide now pour from all side of the monster like brook down a hill
chapter_61	pull up pull up
chapter_62	the dart
chapter_63	the crotch allude to on a previous page deserve independent mention
chapter_63	thereby the weapon be instantly at hand to -PRON- hurler who snatch -PRON- up as readily from -PRON- rest as a backwoodsman swing -PRON- rifle from the wall
chapter_64	a little item may as well be relate here
chapter_64	if moody ahab be now all quiescence at least so far as could be know on deck stubb -PRON- second mate flush with conquest betray an unusual but still good natured excitement
chapter_64	one small help because of all this liveliness in stubb be soon make strangely manifest
chapter_64	peer over the side -PRON- could just see -PRON- as before -PRON- hear -PRON- wallow in the sullen black water and turn over on -PRON- back as -PRON- scoop out huge globular piece of the whale of the bigness of a human head
chapter_64	the mark -PRON- thus leave on the whale may best be liken to the hollow make by a carpenter in countersinking for a screw
chapter_64	if -PRON- have never see that sight then suspend -PRON- decision about the propriety of devil worship and the expediency of conciliate the devil
chapter_64	-PRON- cry at length widen -PRON- leg still further as if to form a more secure base for -PRON- supper and at the same time dart -PRON- fork into the dish as if stab with -PRON- lance cook -PRON- cook!--sail this way cook
chapter_64	cook go and talk to -PRON- tell -PRON- -PRON- be welcome to help -PRON- civilly and in moderation but -PRON- must keep quiet
chapter_64	massa stubb say dat -PRON- can fill -PRON- dam belly up to de hatching but by gor
chapter_64	-PRON- must stop dat dam racket
chapter_64	"cook here interpose stubb accompany the word with a sudden slap on the shoulder,--""cook"
chapter_64	den preach to -PRON- -PRON- sullenly turn to go
chapter_64	no cook go on go on
chapter_64	do -PRON- be all shark and by natur wery woracious yet -PRON- zay to -PRON- fellow critter dat dat woraciousness--'top dat dam slappin ob de tail
chapter_64	cook cry stubb collar -PRON- -PRON- will not have that swearing
chapter_64	talk to -PRON- gentlemanly
chapter_64	-PRON- woraciousness fellow critter -PRON- do not blame ye so much for dat be natur and can not be help but to gobern dat wicked natur dat be de pint
chapter_64	upon -PRON- soul -PRON- be about of the same opinion so give the benediction fleece and -PRON- will away to -PRON- supper
chapter_64	cuss fellow critter
chapter_64	
chapter_64	well say stubb help -PRON- freely meanwhile -PRON- shall now go back to the subject of this steak
chapter_64	do -PRON- belong to the church
chapter_64	-PRON- mean when -PRON- die cook
chapter_64	when dis old brack man die say the negro slowly change -PRON- whole air and demeanor -PRON- hisself will not go nowhere but some bressed angel will come and fetch -PRON-
chapter_64	fetch -PRON-
chapter_64	but perhaps -PRON- expect to get into heaven by crawl through the lubber 's hole cook but no no cook -PRON- do not get there except -PRON- go the regular way round by the rigging
chapter_64	but none of -PRON- be in heaven yet
chapter_64	what that -PRON- heart there that be -PRON- gizzard
chapter_64	hold the steak in one hand and show a live coal to -PRON- with the other that do dish -PRON- d'ye hear
chapter_65	also that in henry viiith 's time a certain cook of the court obtain a handsome reward for invent an admirable sauce to be eat with barbacu porpoise which -PRON- remember be a species of whale
chapter_65	only the most unprejudiced of man like stubb nowadays partake of cook whale but the esquimaux be not so fastidious
chapter_65	zogranda one of -PRON- most famous doctor recommend strip of blubber for infant as be exceedingly juicy and nourishing
chapter_65	among the dutch whaleman these scrap be call fritter which indeed -PRON- greatly resemble be brown and crisp and smell something like old amsterdam housewife dough nut or oly cook when fresh
chapter_65	look at -PRON- hump which would be as fine eat as the buffalo 's which be esteem a rare dish be -PRON- not such a solid pyramid of fat
chapter_65	but the spermaceti -PRON- how bland and creamy that be like the transparent half jellied white meat of a cocoanut in the third month of -PRON- growth yet far too rich to supply a substitute for butter
chapter_65	look at -PRON- knife handle there -PRON- civilized and enlightened gourmand dining off that roast beef what be that handle make of what but the bone of the brother of the very ox -PRON- be eat
chapter_66	therefore the common usage be to take in all sail lash the helm a'lee and then send every one below to -PRON- hammock till daylight with the reservation that until that time anchor watch shall be keep that is two and two for an hour each couple the crew in rotation shall mount the deck to see that all go well
chapter_66	the whaling spade use for cut in be make of the very good steel be about the bigness of a man 's spread hand and in general shape correspond to the garden implement after which -PRON- be name only -PRON- side be perfectly flat and -PRON- upper end considerably narrower than the low
chapter_67	-PRON- be a saturday night and such a sabbath as follow
chapter_67	-PRON- would have think -PRON- be offer up ten thousand red oxen to the sea god
chapter_67	the end of the hawser like rope wind through these intricacy be then conduct to the windlass and the huge low block of the tackle be swing over the whale to this block the great blubber hook weigh some one hundred pound be attach
chapter_67	now as the blubber envelope the whale precisely as the rind do an orange so be -PRON- strip off from the body precisely as an orange be sometimes strip by spiraliz -PRON-
chapter_67	into this hole the end of the second alternate great tackle be then hooked so as to retain a hold upon the blubber in order to prepare for what follow
chapter_68	the blanket
chapter_68	that blubber be something of the consistence of firm close grain beef but tough more elastic and compact and range from eight or ten to twelve and fifteen inch in thickness
chapter_68	but what -PRON- be drive at here be this
chapter_68	-PRON- should say that those new england rock on the sea coast which agassiz imagine to bear the mark of violent scrap contact with vast float iceberg -PRON- should say that those rock must not a little resemble the sperm whale in this particular
chapter_68	what would become of a greenland whale say in those shudder icy sea of the north if unsuppli with -PRON- cosy surtout
chapter_68	freeze -PRON- blood and -PRON- die
chapter_68	where when seaman fall overboard -PRON- be sometimes find month afterwards perpendicularly freeze into the heart of field of ice as a fly be find glue in amber
chapter_68	do thou too live in this world without be of -PRON-
chapter_68	like the great dome of st. peter 's and like the great whale retain o man in all season a temperature of thine own
chapter_69	beneath the unclouded and mild azure sky upon the fair face of the pleasant sea waft by the joyous breeze that great mass of death float on and on till lose in infinite perspective
chapter_69	the sea vulture all in pious mourning the air shark all punctiliously in black or speckled
chapter_69	from which not the mighty whale be free
chapter_69	espy by some timid man of war or blunder discovery vessel from afar when the distance obscure the swarm fowl nevertheless still show the white mass float in the sun and the white spray heave high against -PRON- straightway the whale 's unharming corpse with tremble finger be set down in the log shoal rocks and breakers hereabouts beware
chapter_69	there be orthodoxy
chapter_69	thus while in life the great whale 's body may have be a real terror to -PRON- foe in -PRON- death -PRON- ghost become a powerless panic to a world
chapter_70	the sphynx
chapter_70	remember also that the surgeon must operate from above some eight or ten foot intervene between -PRON- and -PRON- subject and that subject almost hidden in a discoloured rolling and oftentimes tumultuous and burst sea
chapter_70	but with a full grown leviathan this be impossible for the sperm whale 's head embrace nearly one third of -PRON- entire bulk and completely to suspend such a burden as that even by the immense tackle of a whaler this be as vain a thing as to attempt weigh a dutch barn in jeweller scale
chapter_70	the pequod 's whale be decapitate and the body strip the head be hoist against the ship 's side about half way out of the sea so that -PRON- may yet in great part be buoy up by -PRON- native element
chapter_70	silence reign over the before tumultuous but now deserted deck
chapter_70	-PRON- be a black and hooded head and hang there in the midst of so intense a calm -PRON- seem the sphynx 's in the desert
chapter_70	where unrecorded name and navy rust and untold hope and anchor rot where in -PRON- murderous hold this frigate earth be ballast with bone of million of the drown there in that awful water land there be thy most familiar home
chapter_70	thou hast see enough to split the planet and make an infidel of abraham and not one syllable be thine
chapter_71	but this do by no mean prevent all communication
chapter_71	subject to this and other the like interruption now and then a conversation be sustain between the two party but at interval not without still another interruption of a very different sort pull an oar in the jeroboam 's boat be a man of a singular appearance even in that wild whaling life where individual notability make up all totality
chapter_71	so soon as this figure have be first descry stubb have
chapter_71	that be he!--the long togged scaramouch the town ho 's company tell -PRON- of
chapter_71	the unflinching earnestness with which -PRON- declare these thing the dark daring play of -PRON- sleepless excited imagination and all the preternatural terror of real delirium unite to invest this gabriel in the mind of the majority of the ignorant crew with an atmosphere of sacredness
chapter_71	moreover -PRON- be afraid of -PRON-
chapter_71	as such a man however be not of much practical use in the ship especially as -PRON- refuse to work except when -PRON- please the incredulous captain would fain have be rid of -PRON- but apprise that that individual 's intention be to land -PRON- in the first convenient port the archangel forthwith open all -PRON- seal and vial devote the ship and all hand to unconditional perdition in case this intention be carry out
chapter_71	so strongly do -PRON- work upon -PRON- disciple among the crew that at last in a body -PRON- go to the captain and tell -PRON- if gabriel be send from the ship not a man of -PRON- would remain
chapter_71	the consequence of all this be that the archangel care little or nothing for the captain and mate and since the epidemic have break out -PRON- carry a high hand than ever declare that the plague as -PRON- call -PRON- be at -PRON- sole command nor should -PRON- be stay but accord to -PRON- good pleasure
chapter_71	the sailor mostly poor devil cringe and some of -PRON- fawn before -PRON- in obedience to -PRON- instruction sometimes render -PRON- personal homage as to a god
chapter_71	such thing may seem incredible but however wondrous -PRON- be true
chapter_71	but -PRON- be time to return to the pequod -PRON- fear not thy epidemic man say ahab from the bulwark to captain mayhew who stand in the boat 's stern come on board
chapter_71	beware of the horrible tail
chapter_71	nothing be say for some moment while a succession of riotous wave roll by which by one of those occasional caprice of the sea be tumble not heave -PRON-
chapter_71	meantime the hoist sperm whale 's head jog about very violently and gabriel be see eye -PRON- with rather more apprehensiveness than -PRON- archangel nature seem to warrant
chapter_71	meantime gabriel ascend to the main royal mast head be toss one arm in frantic gesture and hurl forth prophecy of speedy doom to the sacrilegious assailant of -PRON- divinity
chapter_71	a broad white shadow rise from the sea by -PRON- quick fan motion temporarily take the breath out of the body of the oarsman
chapter_71	sometimes nothing be injure but the man who be thus annihilate oftener the boat 's bow be knock off or the thigh board in which the headsman stand be tear from -PRON- place and accompany the body
chapter_71	the whole calamity with the fall form of macey be plainly descry from the ship
chapter_71	
chapter_71	thus most letter never reach -PRON- mark and many be only receive after attain an age of two or three year or more
chapter_71	soon starbuck return with a letter in -PRON- hand
chapter_71	give -PRON- -PRON- man
chapter_71	yell ahab
chapter_71	-PRON- fall at ahab 's foot
chapter_71	then gabriel shriek out to -PRON- comrade to give way with -PRON- oar and in that manner the mutinous boat rapidly shoot away from the pequod as after this interlude the seaman resume -PRON- work upon the jacket of the whale many strange thing be hint in reference to this wild affair
chapter_72	the monkey rope
chapter_72	but in very many case circumstance require that the harpooneer shall remain on the whale till the whole tense or strip operation be conclude
chapter_72	so down there some ten foot below the level of the deck the poor harpooneer flounder about half on the whale and half in the water as the vast mass revolve like a tread mill beneath -PRON-
chapter_72	be the savage 's bowsman that is the person who pull the bow oar in -PRON- boat the second one from forward -PRON- be -PRON- cheerful duty to attend upon -PRON- while take that hard scrabble scramble upon the dead whale 's back
chapter_72	-PRON- have see italian organ boy hold a dancing ape by a long cord
chapter_72	-PRON- hold queequeg down there in the sea by what be technically call in the fishery a monkey rope attach to a strong strip of canvas belt round -PRON- waist
chapter_72	for before -PRON- proceed further -PRON- must be say that the monkey rope be fast at both end fast to queequeg 's broad canvas belt and fast to -PRON- narrow leather one
chapter_72	so then an elongate siamese ligature unite -PRON-
chapter_72	nor could -PRON- possibly forget that do what -PRON- would -PRON- only have the management of one end of -PRON-
chapter_72	this improvement upon the original usage be introduce by no less a man than stubb in order to afford the imperill harpooneer the strong possible guarantee for the faithfulness and vigilance of -PRON- monkey rope holder
chapter_72	-PRON- have hint that -PRON- would often jerk poor queequeg from between the whale and the ship where -PRON- would occasionally fall from the incessant rolling and swaying of both
chapter_72	and right in among those shark be queequeg who often push -PRON- aside with -PRON- flounder foot
chapter_72	suspend over the side in one of the stage tashtego and daggoo continually flourish over -PRON- head a couple of keen whale spade wherewith -PRON- slaughter as many shark as -PRON- could reach
chapter_72	do -PRON- smell ginger
chapter_72	yes this must be ginger peer into the as yet untasted cup
chapter_72	ginger!--what the devil be ginger sea coal
chapter_72	lucifer match tinder gunpowder what the devil be ginger -PRON- say that -PRON- offer this cup to -PRON- poor queequeg here
chapter_72	the steward mr. starbuck have the face to offer that calomel and jalap to queequeg there this instant off the whale
chapter_72	and may -PRON- ask whether this be the sort of bitter by which -PRON- blow back the life into a half drown man
chapter_72	-PRON- have get out insurance on -PRON- life and want to murder -PRON- all and pocket the proceed do ye
chapter_72	-PRON- be not -PRON- cry dough boy -PRON- be aunt charity that bring the ginger on board and bid -PRON- never give the harpooneer any spirit but only this ginger jub so -PRON- call -PRON-
chapter_72	the first contain strong spirit and be hand to queequeg the second be aunt charity 's gift and that be freely give to the wave
chapter_73	for the present other matter press and the good -PRON- can do now for the head be to pray heaven the tackle may hold
chapter_73	and though all hand commonly disdain the capture of those inferior creature and though the pequod be not commission to cruise for -PRON- at all and though -PRON- have pass number of -PRON- near the crozetts without lower a boat yet now that a sperm whale have be bring alongside and behead to the surprise of all the announcement be make that a right whale should be capture that day if opportunity offer
chapter_73	tall spout be see to leeward and two boat stubb 's and flask 's be detach in pursuit
chapter_73	but -PRON- be only a few foot advance -PRON- seek to gain
chapter_73	meantime -PRON- haul more and more upon -PRON- line till close flank -PRON- on both side stubb answer flask with lance for lance and thus round and round the pequod the battle go while the multitude of shark that have before swim round the sperm whale 's body rush to the fresh blood that be spill thirstily drinking at every new gash as the eager israelites do at the new burst fountain that pour from the smitten rock
chapter_73	
chapter_73	flask -PRON- take that fedallah to be the devil in disguise

chapter_73	take -PRON- say the governor and by the lord flask if the devil do not give john the asiatic cholera before -PRON- get through with -PRON- -PRON- will eat this whale in one mouthful
chapter_73	well then pull ahead and let -PRON- get the whale alongside
chapter_73	
chapter_73	do not the devil live for ever who ever hear that the devil be dead
chapter_73	do -PRON- ever see any parson a wear mourning for the devil
chapter_73	tell -PRON- that mr. flask
chapter_73	do -PRON- see that mainmast there
chapter_73	point to the ship well that be the figure one now take all the hoop in the pequod 's hold and string along in a row with that mast for ought do -PRON- see well that would not begin to be fedallah 's age
chapter_73	but see here stubb -PRON- think -PRON- a little boast just now that -PRON- mean to give fedallah a sea toss if -PRON- get a good chance
chapter_73	do -PRON- suppose fedallah want to kidnap captain ahab
chapter_73	do with -PRON-
chapter_73	do not -PRON- tell -PRON- so
chapter_73	oh ye foolish
chapter_73	throw all these thunder head overboard and then -PRON- will float light and right
chapter_73	the carcase of both whale have drop astern and the head laden ship not a little resemble a mule carry a pair of overburden pannier
chapter_73	and ahab chance so to stand that the parsee occupy -PRON- shadow while if the parsee 's shadow be there at all -PRON- seem only to blend with and lengthen ahab 's
chapter_74	but -PRON- must be content with a hint
chapter_74	but the ear of the whale be full as curious as the eye
chapter_74	with respect to -PRON- ear this important difference be to be observe between the sperm whale and the right
chapter_74	but if -PRON- eye be broad as the lens of herschel 's great telescope and -PRON- ear capacious as the porch of cathedral would that make -PRON- any long of sight or sharp of hearing
chapter_74	subtilize -PRON-
chapter_74	let -PRON- now with whatev lever and steam engine -PRON- have at hand can not over the sperm whale 's head that -PRON- may lie bottom up then ascend by a ladder to the summit have a peep down the mouth and be -PRON- not that the body be now completely separate from -PRON- with a lantern -PRON- may descend into the great kentucky mammoth cave of -PRON- stomach
chapter_74	what a really beautiful and chaste look mouth from floor to ceiling line or rather paper with a glisten white membrane glossy as bridal satin
chapter_74	in most case this low jaw be easily unhinge by a practised artist be disengage and hoist on deck for the purpose of extract the ivory tooth and furnish a supply of that hard white whalebone with which the fisherman fashion all sort of curious article include cane umbrella stock and handle to riding whip
chapter_75	the right whale 's head contrast view
chapter_75	and in this same last or shoe that old woman of the nursery tale with the swarm brood may very comfortably be lodge -PRON- and all -PRON- progeny
chapter_75	over this lip as over a slippery threshold -PRON- now slide into the mouth
chapter_75	as every one know these same hog bristle fin whisker blind or whatev -PRON- please furnish to the lady -PRON- busk and other stiffen contrivance
chapter_75	for a carpet to the organ -PRON- have a rug of the soft turkey the tongue which be glue as -PRON- be to the floor of the mouth
chapter_75	look -PRON- last now on these venerable hooded head while -PRON- yet lie together for one will soon sink unrecorded in the sea the other will not be very long in follow
chapter_75	see that amazing low lip press by accident against the vessel 's side so as firmly to embrace the jaw
chapter_76	here be a vital point for -PRON- must either satisfactorily settle this matter with -PRON- or for ever remain an infidel as to one of the most appalling but not the less true event perhaps anywhere to be find in all record history
chapter_76	moreover -PRON- observe that the whale have no external nose and that what nose -PRON- have -PRON- spout hole be on the top of -PRON- head -PRON- observe that -PRON- eye and ear be at the side of -PRON- head nearly one third of -PRON- entire length from the front
chapter_76	furthermore -PRON- be now to consider that only in the extreme low backward slop part of the front of the head be there the slight vestige of bone and not till -PRON- get near twenty foot from the forehead
chapter_76	bethink -PRON- also of another thing
chapter_76	no -PRON- hold there a large round wad of tow and cork envelop in the thick and tough of ox hide
chapter_76	if this be so fancy the irresistibleness of that may to which the most impalpable and destructive of all element contribute
chapter_76	now mark
chapter_77	-PRON- know not that -PRON- have be define before
chapter_77	the upper part know as the case may be regard as the great heidelburgh tun of the sperm whale
chapter_77	and as that famous great tierce be mystically carve in front so the whale 's vast plaited forehead form innumerable strange device for the emblematical adornment of -PRON- wondrous tun
chapter_77	moreover as that of heidelburgh be always replenish with the most excellent of the wine of the rhenish valley so the tun of the whale contain by far the most precious of all -PRON- oily vintage namely the highly prize spermaceti in -PRON- absolutely pure limpid and odoriferous state
chapter_77	-PRON- know not with what fine and costly material the heidelburgh tun be coat within but in superlative richness that coating could not possibly have compare with the silken pearl coloured membrane like the lining of a fine pelisse form the inner surface of the sperm whale 's case
chapter_77	-PRON- will have be see that the heidelburgh tun of the sperm whale embrace the entire length of the entire top of the head and since as have be elsewhere set forth the head embrace one third of the whole length of the creature then set that length down at eighty foot for a good sized whale -PRON- have more than twenty six foot for the depth of the tun when -PRON- be lengthwise hoist up and down against a ship 's side
chapter_78	then hand over hand down the other part the indian drop through the air till dexterously -PRON- land on the summit of the head
chapter_78	there still high elevated above the rest of the company to whom -PRON- vivaciously cry -PRON- seem some turkish muezzin call the good people to prayer from the top of a tower
chapter_78	these last now hoist the bucket within grasp of the indian to whom another person have reach up a very long pole
chapter_78	come down come down
chapter_78	in heaven 's name man cry stubb be -PRON- ram home a cartridge there
chapter_78	the next a loud splash announce that -PRON- brave queequeg have dive to the rescue
chapter_78	both
chapter_78	as for the great head -PRON- that be do as well as could be expect
chapter_78	-PRON- have thee there
chapter_78	but the tendency to rapid sinking in this substance be in the present instance materially counteract by the other part of the head remain undetached from -PRON- so that -PRON- sink very slowly and deliberately indeed afford queequeg a fair chance for perform -PRON- agile obstetric on the run as -PRON- may say
chapter_79	the prairie
chapter_79	a nose to the whale would have be impertinent
chapter_79	a pestilent conceit which so often will insist upon obtrude even when behold the mighty royal beadle on -PRON- throne
chapter_79	in some particular perhaps the most impose physiognomical view to be have of the sperm whale be that of the full front of -PRON- head
chapter_79	"-PRON- signifies--""god do this day by -PRON- hand"
chapter_79	few be the forehead which like shakespeare 's or melancthon 's rise so high and descend so low that the eye -PRON- seem clear eternal tideless mountain lake and all above -PRON- in the forehead 's wrinkle -PRON- seem to track the antlered thought descend there to drink as the highland hunter track the snow print of the deer
chapter_79	in profile -PRON- plainly perceive that horizontal semi crescentic depression in the forehead 's middle which in man be lavater 's mark of genius
chapter_79	and this remind -PRON- that have the great sperm whale be know to the young orient world -PRON- would have be deify by -PRON- child magian thought
chapter_79	if hereafter any highly cultured poetical nation shall lure back to -PRON- birth right the merry may day god of old and livingly enthrone -PRON- again in the now egotistical sky in the now unhaunted hill then be sure exalt to jove 's high seat the great sperm whale shall lord -PRON-
chapter_79	champollion decipher the wrinkled granite hieroglyphic
chapter_80	but in life as -PRON- have elsewhere see this inclined plane be angularly fill up and almost square by the enormous superincumbent mass of the junk and sperm
chapter_80	so like a choice casket be -PRON- secrete in -PRON- that -PRON- have know some whaleman who peremptorily deny that the sperm whale have any other brain than that palpable semblance of one form by the cubic yard of -PRON- sperm magazine
chapter_80	but if from the comparative dimension of the whale 's proper brain -PRON- deem -PRON- incapable of be adequately chart then -PRON- have another idea for -PRON-
chapter_80	but the curious external resemblance -PRON- take -PRON- the germans be not the first man to perceive
chapter_80	apply this spinal branch of phrenology to the sperm whale
chapter_80	from -PRON- relative situation then -PRON- should call this high hump the organ of firmness or indomitableness in the sperm whale
chapter_81	the pequod meet the virgin
chapter_81	the predestinated day arrive and -PRON- duly meet the ship jungfrau derick de deer master of bremen
chapter_81	what have -PRON- in -PRON- hand there cry starbuck point to something wavingly hold by the german
chapter_81	not that say stubb no no -PRON- be a coffee pot mr. starbuck -PRON- be come off to make -PRON- -PRON- coffee be the yarman do not -PRON- see that big tin can there alongside of -PRON-
chapter_81	-PRON- be out of oil and have come a begging
chapter_81	as -PRON- mount the deck ahab abruptly accost -PRON- without at all heed what -PRON- have in -PRON- hand but in -PRON- broken lingo the german soon evince -PRON- complete ignorance of the white whale immediately turn the conversation to -PRON- lamp feeder and oil can with some remark touch -PRON- have to turn into -PRON- hammock at night in profound darkness -PRON- last drop of bremen oil be go and not a single flying fish yet capture to supply the deficiency conclude by hint that -PRON- ship be indeed what in the fishery be technically call a clean one that is an empty one well deserve the name of jungfrau or the virgin
chapter_81	now the game have rise to leeward -PRON- and the other three german boat that soon follow -PRON- have considerably the start of the pequod 's keel
chapter_81	aware of -PRON- danger -PRON- be go all abreast with great speed straight before the wind rub -PRON- flank as closely as so many span of horse in harness
chapter_81	who be get some paregoric
chapter_81	adverse wind be hold mad christmas in -PRON- boy
chapter_81	only wait a bit old chap and -PRON- will give ye a sling for that wounded arm cry cruel flask point to the whale line near -PRON-
chapter_81	give way or the german will have -PRON-
chapter_81	as for derick -PRON- seem quite confident that this would be the case and occasionally with a deride gesture shake -PRON- lamp feeder at the other boat
chapter_81	who be that be drop an anchor overboard -PRON- do not budge an inch we're becalm
chapter_81	the short and long of -PRON- be man will ye spit fire or not
chapter_81	the unmannerly dutch dogger cry stubb
chapter_81	what d'ye say
chapter_81	what d'ye say
chapter_81	hurrah for the white ash breeze
chapter_81	while this clumsy lubber be strive to free -PRON- white ash and while in consequence derick 's boat be nigh to capsizing and -PRON- thunder away at -PRON- man in a mighty rage that be a good time for starbuck stubb and flask
chapter_81	so have -PRON- see a bird with clipped wing make affright broken circle in the air vainly strive to escape the piratical hawk
chapter_81	this be the way a fellow feel when -PRON- be go to davy jones all a rush down an endless inclined plane
chapter_81	-PRON- all know what an astonishing atmospheric weight -PRON- -PRON- stand up under even here above ground in the air how vast then the burden of a whale bear on -PRON- back a column of two hundred fathom of ocean
chapter_81	suspend
chapter_81	and to what
chapter_81	"be this the creature of whom -PRON- be once so triumphantly said--""canst thou fill -PRON- skin with barbed iron or -PRON- head with fish spear"
chapter_81	-PRON- esteemeth iron as straw the arrow can not make -PRON- flee dart be count as stubble -PRON- laugheth at the shaking of a spear
chapter_81	this the creature
chapter_81	haul in cry starbuck again -PRON- be rise
chapter_81	the line of which hardly an instant before not one hand 's breadth could have be gain be now in long quick coil fling back all drip into the boat and soon the whale break water within two ship 's length of the hunter
chapter_81	yet so vast be the quantity of blood in -PRON- and so distant and numerous -PRON- interior fountain that -PRON- will keep thus bleed and bleed for a considerable period even as in a drought a river will flow whose source be in the well spring of far off and undiscernible hill
chapter_81	as the boat now more closely surround -PRON- the whole upper part of -PRON- form with much of -PRON- that be ordinarily submerge be plainly reveal
chapter_81	-PRON- so chance that almost upon first cutting into -PRON- with the spade the entire length of a corroded harpoon be find imbed in -PRON- flesh on the low part of the bunch before describe
chapter_81	and when
chapter_81	meantime everything in the pequod be aslant
chapter_81	the ship groan and gasp
chapter_81	cry stubb to the body do not be in such a devil of a hurry to sink
chapter_81	aye aye cry queequeg and seize the carpenter 's heavy hatchet -PRON- lean out of a porthole and steel to iron begin slash at the large fluke chain
chapter_81	a line of battle ship could hardly keep -PRON- under then
chapter_82	the honour and glory of whaling
chapter_82	there be some enterprise in which a careful disorderliness be the true method
chapter_82	-PRON- impressed with -PRON- great honourableness and antiquity and especially when -PRON- find so many great demi god and hero prophet of all sort who one way or other have shed distinction upon -PRON- -PRON- be transport with the reflection that -PRON- -PRON- belong though but subordinately to so emblazon a fraternity
chapter_82	and therefore let not the knight of that honourable company none of whom -PRON- venture to say have ever have to do with a whale like -PRON- great patron let -PRON- never eye a nantucketer with disdain since even in -PRON- woollen frock and tarred trowser -PRON- be much better entitle to st. george 's decoration than -PRON-
chapter_82	whether to admit hercules among -PRON- or not concern this -PRON- long remain dubious for though accord to the greek mythology that antique crockett and kit carson that brawny doer of rejoice good deed be swallow down and throw up by a whale still whether that strictly make a whaleman of -PRON- that may be moot
chapter_82	-PRON- claim -PRON- for one of -PRON- clan
chapter_82	but by the good contradictory authority this grecian story of hercules and the whale be consider to be derive from the still more ancient hebrew story of jonah and the whale and vice versa certainly -PRON- be very similar
chapter_82	-PRON- grand master be still to be name for like royal king of old time -PRON- find the head water of -PRON- fraternity in nothing short of the great god -PRON-
chapter_82	vishnoo -PRON- for -PRON- lord
chapter_82	perseus st. george hercules jonah and vishnoo
chapter_83	historically regarded
chapter_83	-PRON- have one of those quaint old fashioned bible embellish with curious unscientific plate one of which represent jonah 's whale with two spout in -PRON- head a peculiarity only true with respect to a species of the leviathan the right whale and the variety of that order concern which the fisherman have this saying a penny roll would choke -PRON- -PRON- swallow be so very small
chapter_83	besides -PRON- have be divine by other continental commentator that when jonah be throw overboard from the joppa ship -PRON- straightway effect -PRON- escape to another vessel near by some vessel with a whale for a figure head and -PRON- would add possibly called the whale as some craft be nowadays christen the shark the gull the eagle
chapter_83	poor sag harbor therefore seem worst all round
chapter_83	but -PRON- have still another reason for -PRON- want of faith
chapter_83	-PRON- may have carry -PRON- round by the way of the cape of good hope
chapter_83	besides this idea of jonah 's weather the cape of good hope at so early a day would wrest the honour of the discovery of that great headland from bartholomew diaz -PRON- reputed discoverer and so make modern history a liar
chapter_83	-PRON- say -PRON- only show -PRON- foolish impious pride and abominable devilish rebellion against the reverend clergy
chapter_83	for by a portuguese catholic priest this very idea of jonah be go to nineveh via the cape of good hope be advance as a signal magnification of the general miracle
chapter_83	and some three century ago an english traveller in old harris 's voyages speak of a turkish mosque build in honour of jonah in which mosque be a miraculous lamp that burn without any oil
chapter_84	queequeg believe strongly in anoint -PRON- boat and one morning not long after the german ship jungfrau disappear take more than customary pain in that occupation crawl under -PRON- bottom where -PRON- hang over the side and rub in the unctuousness as though diligently seek to insure a crop of hair from the craft 's bald keel
chapter_84	of all the wondrous device and dexterity the sleight of hand and countless subtlety to which the veteran whaleman be so often force none exceed that fine manoeuvre with the lance call pitchpoling
chapter_84	but before go further -PRON- be important to mention here that though the harpoon may be pitchpol in the same way with the lance yet -PRON- be seldom do and when do be still less frequently successful on account of the great weight and inferior length of the harpoon as compare with the lance which in effect become serious drawback
chapter_84	as a general thing therefore -PRON- must first get fast to a whale before any pitchpoling come into play
chapter_84	look now at stubb a man who from -PRON- humorous deliberate coolness and equanimity in the dire emergency be specially qualified to excel in pitchpol
chapter_84	handle the long lance lightly glance twice or thrice along -PRON- length to see if -PRON- be exactly straight stubb whistlingly gather up the coil of the warp in one hand so as to secure -PRON- free end in -PRON- grasp leave the rest unobstructed
chapter_84	-PRON- mind -PRON- somewhat of a juggler balance a long staff on -PRON- chin
chapter_84	next moment with a rapid nameless impulse in a superb lofty arch the bright steel span the foaming distance and quiver in the life spot of the whale
chapter_84	would now -PRON- be old orleans whiskey or old ohio or unspeakable old monongahela
chapter_84	the agonize whale go into -PRON- flurry
chapter_85	the fountain that for six thousand year and no one know how many million of age before the great whale should have be spout all over the sea and sprinkle and mistify the garden of the deep as with so many sprinkle or mistify pot and that for some century back thousand of hunter should have be close by the fountain of the whale watch these sprinkling and spouting that all this should be and yet that down to this blessed minute fifteen and a quarter minute past one o'clock p.m. of this sixteenth day of december a.d. 1851 -PRON- should still remain a problem whether these spouting be after all really water or nothing but vapour this be surely a noteworthy thing
chapter_85	every one know that by the peculiar cunning of -PRON- gill the finny tribe in general breathe the air which at all time be combine with the element in which -PRON- swim hence a herring or a cod may live a century and never once raise -PRON- head above the surface
chapter_85	wherefore the necessity for -PRON- periodical visit to the upper world
chapter_85	if -PRON- say that in any creature breathing be only a function indispensable to vitality inasmuch as -PRON- withdraw from the air a certain element which be subsequently bring into contact with the blood impart to the blood -PRON- vivify principle -PRON- do not think -PRON- shall err though -PRON- may possibly use some superfluous scientific word
chapter_85	so that for an hour or more a thousand fathom in the sea -PRON- carry a surplus stock of vitality in -PRON- just as the camel cross the waterless desert carry a surplus supply of drink for future use in -PRON- four supplementary stomach
chapter_85	remark however that in different individual these rate be different but in any one -PRON- be alike
chapter_85	-PRON- have be say that the whale only breathe through -PRON- spout hole if -PRON- could truthfully be add that -PRON- spout be mixed with water then -PRON- opine -PRON- should be furnish with the reason why -PRON- sense of smell seem obliterate in -PRON- for the only thing about -PRON- that at all answer to -PRON- nose be that identical spout hole and be so clog with two element -PRON- could not be expect to have the power of smell
chapter_85	but owe to the mystery of the spout whether -PRON- be water or whether -PRON- be vapour no absolute certainty can as yet be arrive at on this head
chapter_85	now the spout canal of the sperm whale chiefly intend as -PRON- be for the conveyance of air and for several foot lay along horizontally just beneath the upper surface of -PRON- head and a little to one side this curious canal be very much like a gas pipe lay down in a city on one side of a street
chapter_85	besides if -PRON- regard -PRON- very closely and time -PRON- with -PRON- watch -PRON- will find that when unmolest there be an undeviating rhyme between the period of -PRON- jet and the ordinary period of respiration
chapter_85	speak out
chapter_85	-PRON- have ever find -PRON- plain thing the knotty of all
chapter_85	and -PRON- know one who come into still close contact with the spout whether with some scientific object in view or otherwise -PRON- can not say the skin peel off from -PRON- cheek and arm
chapter_85	wherefore among whaleman the spout be deem poisonous -PRON- try to evade -PRON-
chapter_85	while compose a little treatise on eternity -PRON- have the curiosity to place a mirror before -PRON- and ere long saw reflect there a curious involve worming and undulation in the atmosphere over -PRON- head
chapter_86	other poet have warble the praise of the soft eye of the antelope and the lovely plumage of the bird that never alight less celestial -PRON- celebrate a tail
chapter_86	reckon the large sized sperm whale 's tail to begin at that point of the trunk where -PRON- taper to about the girth of a man -PRON- comprise upon -PRON- upper surface alone an area of at least fifty square foot
chapter_86	the entire member seem a dense webbed bed of weld sinew but cut into -PRON- and -PRON- find that three distinct stratum compose -PRON- upper middle and low
chapter_86	the fibre in the upper and low layer be long and horizontal those of the middle one very short and run crosswise between the outside layer
chapter_86	could annihilation occur to matter this be the thing to do -PRON-
chapter_86	take away the tie tendon that all over seem burst from the marble in the carve hercules and -PRON- charm would be go
chapter_86	as devout eckerman lift the linen sheet from the naked corpse of goethe -PRON- be overwhelmed with the massive chest of the man that seem as a roman triumphal arch
chapter_86	therein no fairy 's arm can transcend -PRON-
chapter_86	first be horizontal in -PRON- position the leviathan 's tail act in a different manner from the tail of all other sea creature
chapter_86	-PRON- never wriggle
chapter_86	-PRON- be this which give that singular dart leap motion to the monster when furiously swim
chapter_86	if -PRON- be make in the unobstructed air especially if -PRON- descend to -PRON- mark the stroke be then simply irresistible
chapter_86	have this tail any prehensile power -PRON- should straightway bethink -PRON- of darmonodes elephant that so frequent the flower market and with low salutation present nosegay to damsel and then caress -PRON- zone
chapter_86	fourth steal unawares upon the whale in the fancy security of the middle of solitary sea -PRON- find -PRON- unbent from the vast corpulence of -PRON- dignity and kitten like -PRON- play on the ocean as if -PRON- be a hearth
chapter_86	but still -PRON- see -PRON- power in -PRON- play
chapter_86	as ptolemy philopater testify of the african elephant -PRON- then testify of the whale pronounce -PRON- the most devout of all being
chapter_86	for accord to king juba the military elephant of antiquity often hail the morning with -PRON- trunk uplift in the profound silence
chapter_86	the chance comparison in this chapter between the whale and the elephant so far as some aspect of the tail of the one and the trunk of the other be concern should not tend to place those two opposite organ on an equality much less the creature to which -PRON- respectively belong
chapter_86	
chapter_86	-PRON- be well known that the elephant will often draw up water or dust in -PRON- trunk and then elevate -PRON- jet -PRON- forth in a stream
chapter_86	dissect -PRON- how -PRON- may then -PRON- but go skin deep -PRON- know -PRON- not and never will
chapter_87	the shore of the straits of sunda be unsuppli with those domineering fortress which guard the entrance to the mediterranean the baltic and the propontis
chapter_87	but while -PRON- freely waive a ceremonial like this -PRON- do by no mean renounce -PRON- claim to more solid tribute
chapter_87	by these mean the circumnavigate pequod would sweep almost all the know sperm whale cruising ground of the world previous to descend upon the line in the pacific where ahab though everywhere else foil in -PRON- pursuit firmly count upon give battle to moby dick in the sea -PRON- be most known to frequent and at a season when -PRON- may most reasonably be presume to be haunt -PRON-
chapter_87	surely -PRON- will stop for water
chapter_87	while other hull be load down with alien stuff to be transfer to foreign wharf the world wander whale ship carry no cargo but -PRON- and crew -PRON- weapon and -PRON- want
chapter_87	-PRON- be ballast with utility not altogether with unusable pig lead and kentledge
chapter_87	clear old prime nantucket water which when three year afloat the nantucketer in the pacific prefer to drink before the brackish fluid but yesterday raft off in cask from the peruvian or indian stream
chapter_87	now as many sperm whales have be capture off the western coast of java in the near vicinity of the straits of sunda indeed as most of the ground roundabout be generally recognise by the fisherman as an excellent spot for cruising therefore as the pequod gain more and more upon java head the look out be repeatedly hail and admonish to keep wide awake
chapter_87	almost renounce all thought of fall in with any game hereabouts the ship have well nigh enter the strait when the customary cheering cry be hear from aloft and ere long a spectacle of singular magnificence salute -PRON-
chapter_87	crowd all sail the pequod press after -PRON- the harpooneer handle -PRON- weapon and loudly cheer from the head of -PRON- yet suspend boat
chapter_87	and who could tell whether in that congregate caravan moby dick -PRON- may not temporarily be swim like the worship white elephant in the coronation procession of the siamese
chapter_87	but still drive on in the wake of the whale at length -PRON- seem abate -PRON- speed gradually the ship near -PRON- and the wind now die away word be pass to spring to the boat
chapter_87	best therefore withhold any amazement at the strangely gallied whale before -PRON- for there be no folly of the beast of the earth which be not infinitely outdo by the madness of man
chapter_87	but not a bit daunted queequeg steer -PRON- manfully now sheer off from this monster directly across -PRON- route in advance now edge away from that whose colossal fluke be suspend overhead while all the time starbuck stand up in the bow lance in hand prick out of -PRON- way whatev whale -PRON- could reach by short darts for there be no time to make long one
chapter_87	hard down with -PRON- tail there cry a second to another which close to -PRON- gunwale seem calmly cool -PRON- with -PRON- own fan like extremity
chapter_87	hence -PRON- be that at time like these the drugg come into requisition
chapter_87	but upon fling the third in the act of toss overboard the clumsy wooden block -PRON- catch under one of the seat of the boat and in an instant tear -PRON- out and carry -PRON- away drop the oarsman in the boat 's bottom as the seat slide from under -PRON-
chapter_87	on both side the sea come in at the wound plank but -PRON- stuff two or three drawer and shirt in and so stop the leak for the time
chapter_87	so that when at last the jerk harpoon draw out and the tow whale sideways vanish then with the taper force of -PRON- parting momentum -PRON- glide between two whale into the innermost heart of the shoal as if from some mountain torrent -PRON- have slide into a serene valley lake
chapter_87	now inclusive of the occasional wide interval between the revolving outer circle and inclusive of the space between the various pod in any one of those circle the entire area at this juncture embrace by the whole multitude must have contain at least two or three square mile
chapter_87	queequeg pat -PRON- forehead starbuck scratch -PRON- back with -PRON- lance but fearful of the consequence for the time refrain from dart -PRON-
chapter_87	for suspend in those watery vault float the form of the nursing mother of the whale and those that by -PRON- enormous girth seem shortly to become mother
chapter_87	what ail ye man cry starbuck
chapter_87	look e here say queequeg point down
chapter_87	a whale wound as -PRON- afterwards learn in this part but not effectually as -PRON- seem have break away from the boat carry along with -PRON- half of the harpoon line and in the extraordinary agony of the wound -PRON- be now dash among the revolving circle like the lone mount desperado arnold at the battle of saratoga carry dismay wherever -PRON- go
chapter_87	but at length -PRON- perceive that by one of the unimaginable accident of the fishery this whale have become entangled in the harpoon line that -PRON- tow -PRON- have also run away with the cutting spade in -PRON- and while the free end of the rope attach to that weapon have permanently catch in the coil of the harpoon line round -PRON- tail the cutting spade -PRON- have work loose from -PRON- flesh
chapter_87	a low advance hum be soon hear and then like to the tumultuous mass of block ice when the great river hudson break up in spring the entire host of whale come tumble upon -PRON- inner centre as if to pile -PRON- up in one common mountain
chapter_87	instantly starbuck and queequeg change place starbuck take the stern oars
chapter_87	spring man pull man never mind -PRON- back scrape them!--scrape away
chapter_87	after many similar hair breadth escape -PRON- at last swiftly glide into what have just be one of the outer circle but now cross by random whale all violently make for one centre
chapter_87	riotous and disordered as the universal commotion now be -PRON- soon resolve -PRON- into what seem a systematic movement for have clump together at last in one dense body -PRON- then renew -PRON- onward flight with augmented fleetness
chapter_87	of all the drug whale only one be capture
chapter_88	-PRON- meet -PRON- on the line in time for the full flower of the equatorial feeding season have just return perhaps from spend the summer in the northern sea and so cheat summer of all unpleasant weariness and warmth
chapter_88	not a few be capture have the deep scar of these encounter furrow head broken tooth scolloped fin and in some instance wrench and dislocate mouth
chapter_88	but suppose the invader of domestic bliss to betake -PRON- away at the first rush of the harem 's lord then be -PRON- very divert to watch that lord
chapter_88	as for the son and the daughter -PRON- beget why those son and daughter must take care of -PRON- at least with only the maternal help
chapter_88	in good time nevertheless as the ardour of youth decline as year and dump increase as reflection lend -PRON- solemn pause in short as a general lassitude overtake the sate turk then a love of ease and virtue supplant the love for maiden -PRON- ottoman enter upon the impotent repentant admonitory stage of life forswear disband the harem and grow to an exemplary sulky old soul go about all alone among the meridian and parallel say -PRON- prayer and warn each young leviathan from -PRON- amorous error
chapter_88	now as the harem of whale be call by the fisherman a school so be the lord and master of that school technically know as the schoolmaster
chapter_88	for while those female whale be characteristically timid the young male or forty barrel bull as -PRON- call -PRON- be by far the most pugnacious of all leviathans and proverbially the most dangerous to encounter except those wondrous grey head grizzled whale sometimes meet and these will fight -PRON- like grim fiend exasperate by a penal gout
chapter_88	and so long as -PRON- to fall a prey
chapter_89	-PRON- be decree by the states general in a.d. 1695
chapter_89	yes these law may be engraven on a queen anne 's forthing or the barb of a harpoon and wear round the neck
chapter_89	so small be -PRON-

chapter_89	alive or dead a fish be technically fast when -PRON- be connect with an occupy ship or boat by any medium at all controllable by the occupant or occupant a mast an oar a nine inch cable a telegraph wire or a strand of cobweb -PRON- be all the same
chapter_89	some fifty year ago there be a curious case of whale trover litigate in england wherein the plaintiff set forth that after a hard chase of a whale in the northern sea and when indeed -PRON- the plaintiff have succeed in harpoon the fish -PRON- be at last through peril of -PRON- life oblige to forsake not only -PRON- line but -PRON- boat -PRON-
chapter_89	wherefore the plaintiff now sue for the recovery of the value of -PRON- whale line harpoon and boat
chapter_89	in the course of the defence the witty erskine go on to illustrate -PRON- position by allude to a recent crim
chapter_89	erskine be on the other side and -PRON- then support -PRON- by say that though the gentleman have originally harpoon the lady and have once have -PRON- fast and only by reason of the great stress of -PRON- plunge viciousness have at last abandon -PRON- yet abandon -PRON- -PRON- do so that -PRON- become a loose fish and therefore when a subsequent gentleman re harpoon -PRON- the lady then become that subsequent gentleman 's property along with whatev harpoon may have be find stick in -PRON-
chapter_89	be -PRON- not a saying in every one 's mouth possession be half of the law that is regardless of how the thing come into possession
chapter_89	what be the sinew and soul of russian serf and republican slave but fast fish whereof possession be the whole of the law
chapter_89	what be the ruinous discount which mordecai the broker get from poor woebegone the bankrupt on a loan to keep woebegone 's family from starvation what be that ruinous discount but a fast fish
chapter_89	what to that redoubt harpooneer john bull be poor ireland but a fast fish
chapter_89	and concern all these be not possession the whole of the law
chapter_89	but if the doctrine of fast fish be pretty generally applicable the kindred doctrine of loose fish be still more widely so
chapter_90	now the cinque ports be partially or somehow under the jurisdiction of a sort of policeman or beadle call a lord warden
chapter_90	
chapter_90	
chapter_90	will not the duke be content with a quarter or a half
chapter_90	to which -PRON- lord duke in substance reply both letter be publish that -PRON- have already do so and receive the money and would be oblige to the reverend gentleman if for the future -PRON- the reverend gentleman would decline meddle with other people 's business
chapter_90	-PRON- must need inquire then on what principle the sovereign be originally invest with that right
chapter_90	in -PRON- treatise on queen gold or queen pinmoney an old king 's bench author one william prynne thus discourseth ye tail be ye queen 's that ye queen 's wardrobe may be supply with ye whalebone
chapter_90	and thus there seem a reason in all thing even in law
chapter_91	as -PRON- glide nearer the stranger show french colour from -PRON- peak and by the eddying cloud of vulture sea fowl that circle and hover and swoop around -PRON- -PRON- be plain that the whale alongside must be what the fisherman call a blast whale that is a whale that have die unmolested on the sea and so float an unappropriated corpse
chapter_91	-PRON- may well be conceive what an unsavory odor such a mass must exhale bad than an assyrian city in the plague when the living be incompetent to bury the depart
chapter_91	come still nearer with the expire breeze -PRON- see that the frenchman have a second whale alongside and this second whale seem even more of a nosegay than the first
chapter_91	there be a pretty fellow now -PRON- banteringly laugh stand in the ship 's bow there be a jackal for ye
chapter_91	by this time the faint air have become a complete calm so that whether or no the pequod be now fairly entrap in the smell with no hope of escape except by -PRON- breezing up again
chapter_91	though stubb do not understand the bouton part of the inscription yet the word rose and the bulbous figure head put together sufficiently explain the whole to -PRON-
chapter_91	well then -PRON- bouton de rose bud have -PRON- see the white whale
chapter_91	no
chapter_91	air rather gardenny -PRON- should say throw -PRON- a bunch of posy will ye bouton de rose
chapter_91	what in the devil 's name do -PRON- want here
chapter_91	
chapter_91	anything to oblige ye -PRON- sweet and pleasant fellow rejoin stubb and with that -PRON- soon mount to the deck
chapter_91	now and then pair of -PRON- would drop -PRON- work and run up to the mast head to get some fresh air
chapter_91	sound -PRON- carefully stubb further perceive that the guernsey man have not the slight suspicion concern the ambergris
chapter_91	-PRON- be a small and dark but rather delicate looking man for a sea captain with large whisker and moustache however and wear a red cotton velvet vest with watch seal at -PRON- side
chapter_91	why since -PRON- take -PRON- so easy tell -PRON- that now -PRON- have eye -PRON- carefully -PRON- be quite certain that -PRON- be no more fit to command a whale ship than a st. jago monkey
chapter_91	instantly the captain run forward and in a loud voice command -PRON- crew to desist from hoist the cutting tackle and at once cast loose the cable and chain confine the whale to the ship
chapter_91	hearing this the captain vow that -PRON- be the grateful party mean -PRON- and mate and conclude by invite stubb down into -PRON- cabin to drink a bottle of bordeaux
chapter_91	in fact tell -PRON- -PRON- must go
chapter_91	-PRON- say monsieur that -PRON- principle will not admit of -PRON- drinking but that if monsieur want to live another day to drink then monsieur have good drop all four boat and pull the ship away from these whale for -PRON- be so calm -PRON- will not drift
chapter_91	seize -PRON- sharp boat spade -PRON- commence an excavation in the body a little behind the side fin
chapter_91	stubb be begin to look disappointed especially as the horrible nosegay increase when suddenly from out the very heart of this plague there steal a faint stream of perfume which flow through the tide of bad smell without be absorb by -PRON- as one river will flow into and then along with another without at all blend with -PRON- for a time
chapter_91	-PRON- may easily dent -PRON- with -PRON- thumb -PRON- be of a hue between yellow and ash colour
chapter_92	some wine merchant drop a few grain into claret to flavor -PRON-
chapter_92	and likewise call to mind that say of paracelsus about what -PRON- be that maketh the good musk
chapter_92	also forget not the strange fact that of all thing of ill savor cologne water in -PRON- rudimental manufacturing stage be the bad
chapter_92	-PRON- should like to conclude the chapter with the above appeal but can not owe to -PRON- anxiety to repel a charge often make against whaleman and which in the estimation of some already bias mind may be consider as indirectly substantiate by what have be say of the frenchman 's two whale
chapter_92	-PRON- hint that all whale always smell bad
chapter_92	now how do this odious stigma originate
chapter_92	-PRON- opine that -PRON- be plainly traceable to the first arrival of the greenland whaling ship in london more than two century ago
chapter_92	the consequence be that upon break into the hold and unload one of these whale cemetery in the greenland dock a savor be give forth somewhat similar to that arise from excavate an old city grave yard for the foundation of a lie in hospital -PRON- partly surmise also that this wicked charge against whaler may be likewise impute to the existence on the coast of greenland in former time of a dutch village call schmerenburgh or smeerenberg which latter name be the one use by the learn fogo von slack in -PRON- great work on smells a text book on that subject
chapter_92	must -PRON- not be to that famous elephant with jewelled tusk and redolent with myrrh which be lead out of an indian town to do honour to alexander the great
chapter_93	as a general thing these ship keeper be as hardy fellow as the man comprise the boat crew
chapter_93	in outer aspect pip and dough boy make a match like a black pony and a white one of equal development though of dissimilar colour drive in one eccentric span
chapter_93	then come out those fiery effulgence infernally superb then the evil blaze diamond once the divinest symbol of the crystal sky look like some crown jewel steal from the king of hell
chapter_93	now upon the second lowering the boat paddle upon the whale and as the fish receive the dart iron -PRON- give -PRON- customary rap which happen in this instance to be right under poor pip 's seat
chapter_93	tashtego stand in the bow
chapter_93	damn -PRON- cut
chapter_93	tranquilly permit these irregular cursing to evaporate stubb then in a plain business like but still half humorous manner curse pip officially and that do unofficially give -PRON- much wholesome advice
chapter_93	now in general stick to the boat be -PRON- true motto in whaling but case will sometimes happen when leap from the boat be still good
chapter_93	moreover as if perceive at last that if -PRON- should give undiluted conscientious advice to pip -PRON- would be leave -PRON- too wide a margin to jump in for the future stubb suddenly drop all advice and conclude with a peremptory command stick to the boat pip or by the lord -PRON- will not pick -PRON- up if -PRON- jump mind that
chapter_93	-PRON- can not afford to lose whale by the like of -PRON- a whale would sell for thirty time what -PRON- would pip in alabama

chapter_94	with -PRON- gaff the gaffman hook on to a sheet of blubber and strive to hold -PRON- from slip as the ship pitch and lurch about
chapter_95	that office consist in mince the horse piece of blubber for the pot an operation which be conduct at a curious wooden horse plant endwise against the bulwark and with a capacious tub beneath -PRON- into which the mince piece drop fast as the sheet from a rapt orator 's desk

chapter_96	-PRON- be about nine o'clock at night that the pequod 's try work be first start on this present voyage
chapter_96	here be -PRON- say that in a whaling voyage the first fire in the try work have to be feed for a time with wood

chapter_96	-PRON- smell like the left wing of the day of judgment -PRON- be an argument for the pit
chapter_96	this serve for a sea sofa

chapter_98	all the numerous implement which have be in use be likewise faithfully cleanse and put away
chapter_98	to hint to such musked mariner of oil and bone and blubber be little short of audacity

chapter_100	so that what -PRON- take for the white whale 's malice be only -PRON- awkwardness
chapter_100	no possible way for -PRON- to digest that jack knife and fully incorporate -PRON- into -PRON- general bodily system
chapter_100	no thank ye bunger say the english captain -PRON- be welcome to the arm -PRON- have since -PRON- can not help -PRON- and do not know -PRON- then but not to another one
chapter_100	no more white whales for -PRON-
chapter_100	-PRON- have lower for -PRON- once and that have satisfy -PRON-
chapter_100	what be best let alone that accursed thing be not always what least allure
chapter_100	how long since thou saw'st -PRON- last
chapter_100	
chapter_100	good god cry the english captain to whom the question be put
chapter_101	in 1778 a fine ship the amelia fit out for the express purpose and at the sole charge of the vigorous enderbys boldly round cape horn and be the first among the nation to lower a whale boat of any sort in the great south sea
chapter_101	-PRON- be a fine gam -PRON- have and -PRON- be all trump every soul on board
chapter_101	flip
chapter_101	however the mast do not go overboard and by and by -PRON- scramble down so sober that -PRON- have to pass the flip again though the savage salt spray burst down the forecastle scuttle rather too much dilute and pickle -PRON- to -PRON- taste
chapter_101	but all in all take -PRON- from truck to helm consider the dimension of the cook 's boiler include -PRON- own live parchment boiler fore and aft -PRON- say the samuel enderby be a jolly ship of good fare and plenty fine flip and strong crack fellow all and capital from boot heel to hat band
chapter_101	20,000 lb
chapter_101	but this be very far north be -PRON- remember where beer agree well with the constitution upon the equator in -PRON- southern fishery beer would be apt to make the harpooneer sleepy at the mast head and boozy in -PRON- boat and grievous loss may ensue to nantucket and new bedford
chapter_102	hitherto in descriptively treat of the sperm whale -PRON- have chiefly dwell upon the marvel of -PRON- outer aspect or separately and in detail upon some few interior structural feature
chapter_102	but how now ishmael
chapter_102	for be at tranque year ago when attach to the trading ship dey of algiers -PRON- be invite to spend part of the arsacidean holiday with the lord of tranque at -PRON- retired palm villa at pupella a sea side glen not very far distant from what -PRON- sailor call bamboo town -PRON- capital
chapter_102	these admeasurement -PRON- now propose to set before -PRON-
chapter_102	there be a leviathanic museum -PRON- tell -PRON- in hull england one of the whaling port of that country where -PRON- have some fine specimen of fin back and other whale
chapter_102	in both case the strand whale to which these two skeleton belong be originally claim by -PRON- proprietor upon similar ground
chapter_102	king tranquo seize -PRON- because -PRON- want -PRON- and sir clifford because -PRON- be lord of the seignorie of those part
chapter_103	measurement of the whale 's skeleton
chapter_103	in the first place -PRON- wish to lay before -PRON- a particular plain statement touch the living bulk of this leviathan whose skeleton -PRON- be briefly to exhibit
chapter_103	have already in various way put before -PRON- -PRON- skull spout hole jaw tooth tail forehead fin and diver other part -PRON- shall now simply point out what be most interesting in the general bulk of -PRON- unobstructed bone
chapter_103	to -PRON- this vast ivory rib chest with the long unrelieved spine extend far away from -PRON- in a straight line not a little resembled the hull of a great ship new lay upon the stock when only some twenty of -PRON- naked bow rib be insert and the keel be otherwise for the time but a long disconnected timber
chapter_103	from that part the remain rib diminish till the tenth and last only span five foot and some inch
chapter_103	in some of the arsacides -PRON- be use for beam whereon to lay footpath bridge over small stream
chapter_103	in consider these rib -PRON- could not but be strike anew with the circumstance so variously repeat in this book that the skeleton of the whale be by no means the mould of -PRON- invest form
chapter_103	whereas the correspond rib measured but little more than eight foot
chapter_103	the small where the spine taper away into the tail be only two inch in width and look something like a white billiard ball
chapter_103	-PRON- be tell that there be still small one but -PRON- have be lose by some little cannibal urchin the priest 's child who have steal -PRON- to play marble with
chapter_104	such portly term may justly be deem unwarrantably grandiloquent
chapter_104	for in the mere act of pen -PRON- thought of this leviathan -PRON- weary -PRON- and make -PRON- faint with -PRON- outreach comprehensiveness of sweep as if to include the whole circle of the science and all the generation of whale and man and mastodon past present and to come with all the revolving panorama of empire on earth and throughout the whole universe not exclude -PRON- suburb
chapter_104	detached broken fossil of pre adamite whale fragment of -PRON- bone and skeleton have within thirty year past at various interval be find at the base of the alps in lombardy in france in england in scotland and in the states of louisiana mississippi and alabama
chapter_104	but by far the most wonderful of all cetacean relic be the almost complete vast skeleton of an extinct monster find in the year 1842 on the plantation of judge creagh in alabama
chapter_104	here saturn 's grey chaos roll over -PRON- and -PRON- obtain dim shudder glimpse into those polar eternity when wedge bastion of ice press hard upon what be now the tropics and in all the 25,000 mile of this world 's circumference not an inhabitable hand 's breadth of land be visible
chapter_104	but the truth of the matter be that on either side of the temple there be rock that shoot two miles into the sea and wind the whales when -PRON- light upon -PRON-
chapter_105	-PRON- perish
chapter_105	whereas -PRON- have already see that the tape measure give seventy two foot for the skeleton of a large sized modern whale
chapter_105	assuredly -PRON- must conclude so if -PRON- be to credit the account of such gentleman as pliny and the ancient naturalist generally
chapter_105	and this work be publish so late as a.d. 1825
chapter_105	but will any whaleman believe these story
chapter_105	compare the humped herd of whale with the humped herd of buffalo which not forty year ago overspread by ten of thousand the prairie of illinois and missouri and shake -PRON- iron mane and scowl with -PRON- thunder clot brow upon the site of populous river capital where now the polite broker sell -PRON- land at a dollar an inch in such a comparison an irresistible argument would seem furnished to show that the hunt whale can not now escape speedy extinction
chapter_105	forty man in one ship hunt the sperm whales for forty eight month think -PRON- have do extremely well and thank god if at last -PRON- carry home the oil of forty fish
chapter_105	that be all
chapter_105	and equally fallacious seem the conceit that because the so call whale bone whale no longer haunt many ground in former year abound with -PRON- hence that specie also be decline
chapter_105	for -PRON- be only be drive from promontory to cape and if one coast be no longer enliven with -PRON- jet then be sure some other and remoter strand have be very recently startle by the unfamiliar spectacle
chapter_105	but as perhaps fifty of these whale bone whale be harpoon for one cachalot some philosopher of the forecastle have conclude that this positive havoc have already very seriously diminish -PRON- battalion
chapter_105	but though for some time past a number of these whale not less than 13,000 have be annually slay on the nor'-w coast by the americans alone yet there be consideration which render even this circumstance of little or no account as an oppose argument in this matter
chapter_105	and there seem no reason to doubt that if these elephant which have now be hunt for thousand of year by semiramis by porus by hannibal and by all the successive monarch of the east if -PRON- still survive there in great number much more may the great whale outlast all hunting since -PRON- have a pasture to expatiate in which be precisely twice as large as all asia both americas europe and africa new holland and all the isles of the sea combine
chapter_106	ahab 's leg
chapter_106	for think ahab while even the high earthly felicity ever have a certain unsignifying pettiness lurk in -PRON- but at bottom all heartwoe a mystic significance and in some man an archangelic grandeur so do -PRON- diligent tracing out not belie the obvious deduction
chapter_106	unwittingly here a secret have be divulge which perhaps may more properly in set way have be disclose before
chapter_106	and when that functionary appear before -PRON- -PRON- bid -PRON- without delay set about make a new leg and direct the mate to see -PRON- supply with all the stud and joist of jaw ivory sperm whale which have thus far be accumulate on the voyage in order that a careful selection of the stout clearest grain stuff may be secure
chapter_106	this do the carpenter receive order to have the leg complete that night and to provide all the fitting for -PRON- independent of those pertain to the distrust one in use
chapter_106	moreover the ship 's forge be order to be hoist out of -PRON- temporary idleness in the hold and to accelerate the affair the blacksmith be command to proceed at once to the forging of whatev iron contrivance may be need
chapter_107	but most humble though -PRON- be and far from furnish an example of the high humane abstraction
chapter_107	the pequod 's carpenter be no duplicate hence -PRON- now come in person on this stage
chapter_107	yet be this half horrible stolidity in -PRON- involve too as -PRON- appear an all ramify heartlessness yet be -PRON- oddly dash at time with an old crutch like antediluvian wheeze humorousness not unstreaked now and then with a certain grizzled wittiness such as may have serve to pass the time during the midnight watch on the bearded forecastle of noah 's ark
chapter_107	-PRON- be a pure manipulator -PRON- brain if -PRON- have ever have one must have early ooze along into the muscle of -PRON- finger
chapter_107	if -PRON- do not have a common soul in -PRON- -PRON- have a subtle something that somehow anomalously do -PRON- duty
chapter_107	what that be whether essence of quicksilver or a few drop of hartshorn there be no telling
chapter_107	and this -PRON- be this same unaccountable cunning life principle in -PRON- this -PRON- be that keep -PRON- a great part of the time soliloquizing but only like an unreasoning wheel which also hummingly soliloquiz or rather -PRON- body be a sentry box and this soliloquizer on guard there and talk all the time to keep -PRON- awake
chapter_108	so -PRON- go who file old jaw and shinbone
chapter_108	let -PRON- try another
chapter_108	aye now this work better sneezes
chapter_108	-PRON- have see in shop window would not compare at all
chapter_108	-PRON- soak water -PRON- do and of course get rheumatic and have to be doctor sneeze with wash and lotion just like live leg
chapter_108	well manmaker
chapter_108	just in time sir
chapter_108	about -PRON-
chapter_108	this be a cogent vice thou hast here carpenter let -PRON- feel -PRON- grip once
chapter_108	what be prometheus about there
chapter_108	so -PRON- must
chapter_108	-PRON- do deem -PRON- now a most meaning thing that that old greek prometheus who make man -PRON- say should have be a blacksmith and animate -PRON- with fire for what be make in fire must properly belong to fire and so hell 's probable
chapter_108	no but put a sky light on top of -PRON- head to illuminate inward
chapter_108	there take the order and away
chapter_108	thrusted light be bad than present pistol
chapter_108	the fellow 's impious
chapter_108	bone be rather dusty sir take the hint then and when thou art dead never bury thyself under live people 's nose
chapter_108	dear
chapter_108	well then will -PRON- speak thoroughly well for thy work if when -PRON- come to mount this leg thou makest -PRON- shall nevertheless feel another leg in the same identical place with -PRON- that is carpenter -PRON- old lose leg the flesh and blood one -PRON- mean
chapter_108	-PRON- should humbly call -PRON- a poser sir hist then
chapter_108	how long before the leg be do
chapter_108	here -PRON- be proud as greek god and yet stand debtor to this blockhead for a bone to stand on
chapter_108	and yet -PRON- owe for the flesh in the tongue -PRON- brag with
chapter_108	by heaven
chapter_108	so carpenter resuming his work
chapter_108	have a stick of whale 's jaw bone for a wife
chapter_108	and this be -PRON- leg -PRON- will stand on this
chapter_109	-PRON- must up burtons and break out
chapter_109	what -PRON- come twenty thousand mile to get be worth saving sir
chapter_109	
chapter_109	let -PRON- leak
chapter_109	-PRON- will not have the burtons hoist
chapter_109	what care ahab
chapter_109	and -PRON- do dare sir to be forbearing
chapter_109	then unconsciously use the musket for a staff with an iron brow -PRON- pace to and fro in the little cabin but presently the thick plait of -PRON- forehead relaxed and return the gun to the rack -PRON- go to the deck
chapter_109	thou art but too good a fellow starbuck -PRON- say lowly to the mate then raise -PRON- voice to the crew furl the t'gallant sail and close reef the top sail fore and aft back the main yard up burton and break out in the main hold
chapter_110	upon search -PRON- be find that the cask last strike into the hold be perfectly sound and that the leak must be further off
chapter_110	and the drawing near of death which alike level all alike impress all with a last revelation which only an author from the dead could adequately tell
chapter_110	now when this strange circumstance be make known aft the carpenter be at once command to do queequeg 's bidding whatev -PRON- may include
chapter_110	go to -PRON- vice bench the carpenter for convenience sake and general reference now transferringly measure on -PRON- the exact length the coffin be to be and then make the transfer permanent by cut two notch at -PRON- extremity
chapter_110	all by -PRON- own request also biscuit be then range round the side within a flask of fresh water be place at the head and a small bag of woody earth scrap up in the hold at the foot and a piece of sail cloth be roll up for a pillow queequeg now entreat to be lift into -PRON- final bed that -PRON- may make trial of -PRON- comfort if any -PRON- have
chapter_110	-PRON- lie without move a few minute then tell one to go to -PRON- bag and bring out -PRON- little god yojo

chapter_112	the issue be the loss of the extremity of both foot
chapter_112	come hither put up thy gravestone too within the churchyard and come hither till -PRON- marry thee
chapter_112	hearkening to these voice east and west by early sunrise and by fall of eve the blacksmith 's soul respond aye -PRON- come
chapter_113	while yet a little distance from the forge moody ahab pause till at last perth withdraw -PRON- iron from the fire begin hammer -PRON- upon the anvil the red mass send off the spark in thick hover flight some of which fly close to ahab

chapter_113	as then with regular gasp hem -PRON- hammer on the anvil perth pass to -PRON- the glow rod one after the other and the hard press forge shoot up -PRON- intense straight flame the parsee pass silently and bow over -PRON- head towards the fire seem invoke some curse or some blessing on the toil
chapter_113	would'st thou brand -PRON- perth wince for a moment with the pain have -PRON- be but forge -PRON- own branding iron then
chapter_113	for the white fiend
chapter_113	but now for the barb thou must make -PRON- thyself man

chapter_131	as ahab now glide from the dejected delight the strange life buoy hanging at the pequod 's stern come into conspicuous relief

chapter_132	aye toil -PRON- how -PRON- may -PRON- all sleep at last on the field
chapter_133	-PRON- declare that a whale must be near
chapter_133	soon that peculiar odor sometimes to a great distance give forth by the living sperm whale be palpable to all the watch nor be any mariner surprised when after inspect the compass and then the dog vane and then ascertain the precise bearing of the odor as nearly as possible ahab rapidly order the ship 's course to be slightly alter and the sail to be shorten
chapter_133	cry ahab flatten -PRON- face to the sky
chapter_133	all sail be set -PRON- now cast loose the life line reserve for sway -PRON- to the main royal mast head and in a few moment -PRON- be hoist -PRON- thither when while but two third of the way aloft and while peer ahead through the horizontal vacancy between the main top sail and top gallant sail -PRON- raise a gull like cry in the air
chapter_133	fire by the cry which seem simultaneously take up by the three look out the man on deck rush to the rigging to behold the famous whale -PRON- have so long be pursue
chapter_133	cry ahab hail the perched man all around -PRON-
chapter_133	-PRON- see -PRON- almost that same instant sir that captain ahab do and -PRON- cry out say tashtego not the same instant not the same no the doubloon be -PRON- fate reserve the doubloon for -PRON-

chapter_133	soon all the boat but starbuck 's be drop all the boat sail set all the paddle ply with rippling swiftness shoot to leeward and ahab head the onset
chapter_133	as -PRON- near -PRON- the ocean grow still more smooth seem draw a carpet over -PRON- wave seem a noon meadow so serenely -PRON- spread
chapter_133	a gentle joyousness a mighty mildness of repose in swiftness invest the glide whale
chapter_133	not the white bull jupiter swim away with ravished europa cling to -PRON- graceful horn -PRON- lovely leer eye sideways intent upon the maid with smooth bewitching fleetness ripple straight for the nuptial bower in crete not jove not that great majesty supreme do surpass the glorify white whale as -PRON- so divinely swim
chapter_133	moby dick move on still withhold from sight the full terror of -PRON- submerge trunk entirely hide the wrenched hideousness of -PRON- jaw
chapter_133	but soon the fore part of -PRON- slowly rise from the water for an instant -PRON- whole marbleized body form a high arch like virginia 's natural bridge and warningly wave -PRON- banner fluke in the air the grand god reveal -PRON- sound and go out of sight
chapter_133	hoveringly halting and dip on the wing the white sea fowl longingly linger over the agitated pool that -PRON- leave
chapter_133	the breeze now freshen the sea begin to swell
chapter_133	tashtego in long indian file as when heron take wing the white bird be now all fly towards ahab 's boat and when within a few yard begin flutter over the water there wheel round and round with joyous expectant cry
chapter_133	-PRON- vision be keen than man 's ahab could discover no sign in the sea
chapter_133	in this attitude the white whale now shake the slight cedar as a mildly cruel cat -PRON- mouse
chapter_133	and now while both elastic gunwale be spring in and out as the whale dally with the doom craft in this devilish way and from -PRON- body be submerge beneath the boat -PRON- could not be dart at from the bow for the bow be almost inside of -PRON- as -PRON- be and while the other boat involuntarily pause as before a quick crisis impossible to withstand then -PRON- be that monomaniac ahab furious with this tantalizing vicinity of -PRON- foe which place -PRON- all alive and helpless in the very jaw -PRON- hat frenzied with all this -PRON- seize the long bone with -PRON- naked hand and wildly strove to wrench -PRON- from -PRON- gripe
chapter_133	
chapter_133	
chapter_133	this motion be peculiar to the sperm whale
chapter_133	meanwhile ahab half smother in the foam of the whale 's insolent tail and too much of a cripple to swim though -PRON- could still keep afloat even in the heart of such a whirlpool as that helpless ahab 's head be see like a tossed bubble which the least chance shock may burst
chapter_133	with strain eye then -PRON- remain on the outer edge of the direful zone whose centre have now become the old man 's head
chapter_133	"but struggle out of -PRON- again and chance to rise on a tower crest -PRON- shouted,--""sail on the whale!--drive -PRON- off"
chapter_133	far inland nameless wail come from -PRON- as desolate sound from out ravine
chapter_133	but this intensity of -PRON- physical prostration do
chapter_133	in an instant 's compass great heart sometimes condense to one deep pang the sum total of those shallow pain kindly diffuse through feeble man 's whole life
chapter_133	aye sir for -PRON- be not dart this be -PRON- say stubb show -PRON-
chapter_133	there be five oar sir and here be five man
chapter_133	there
chapter_133	there
chapter_133	-PRON- be thus now
chapter_133	but the add power of the boat do not equal the add power of the whale for -PRON- seem to have treble bank -PRON- every fin swim with a velocity which plainly show that if now under these circumstance push on the chase would prove an indefinitely prolong if not a hopeless one nor could any crew endure for so long a period such an unintermitted intense straining at the oar a thing barely tolerable only in some one brief vicissitude
chapter_133	the ship -PRON- then as -PRON- sometimes happen offer the most promising intermediate mean of overtake the chase
chapter_133	"at the well know methodic interval the whale 's glitter spout be regularly announce from the manned mast head and when -PRON- would be report as just go down ahab would take the time and then pace the deck binnacle watch in hand so soon as the last second of the allot hour expire -PRON- voice be heard.--""whose be the doubloon now"
chapter_133	-PRON- prick -PRON- mouth too keenly sir ha ha
chapter_133	man man do -PRON- not know thee brave as fearless fire and as mechanical

chapter_133	can not see the spout now sir too dark cry a voice from the air
chapter_133	
chapter_133	helm there
chapter_133	keep -PRON- full before the wind!--aloft
chapter_133	away now!--the deck be thine sir
chapter_133	and so say -PRON- place -PRON- half way within the scuttle and slouch -PRON- hat stand there till dawn except when at interval rouse -PRON- to see how the night wear on
chapter_134	the chase second day
chapter_134	but no matter--'tis but rest for the rush
chapter_134	and as the mighty iron leviathan of the modern railway be so familiarly known in -PRON- every pace that with watch in -PRON- hand man time -PRON- rate as doctor that of a baby 's pulse and lightly say of -PRON- the up train or the down train will reach such or such a spot at such or such an hour even so almost there be occasion when these nantucketers time that other leviathan of the deep accord to the observe humor of -PRON- speed and say to -PRON- so many hour hence this whale will have go two hundred mile will have about reach this or that degree of latitude or longitude
chapter_134	but to render this acuteness at all successful in the end the wind and the sea must be the whaleman 's ally for of what present avail to the becalmed or windbound mariner be the skill that assure -PRON- -PRON- be exactly ninety three league and a quarter from -PRON- port
chapter_134	inferable from these statement be many collateral subtile matter touch the chase of whale
chapter_134	the ship tear on leave such a furrow in the sea as when a cannon ball missent become a plough share and turn up the level field
chapter_134	some one take -PRON- up and launch -PRON- spine wise on the sea for by live oak
chapter_134	blister -PRON- lungs!--ahab will dam off -PRON- blood as a miller shut -PRON- watergate upon the stream
chapter_134	the triumphant halloo of thirty buckskin lung be hear as much nearer to the ship than the place of the imaginary jet less than a mile ahead
chapter_134	lower away -PRON- cry so soon as -PRON- have reach -PRON- boat a spare one rig the afternoon previous
chapter_134	seize the boat knife -PRON- critically reach within through and then without the ray of steel drag in the line beyond pass -PRON- inboard to the bowsman and then twice sunder the rope near the chock drop the intercept fagot of steel into the sea and be all fast again
chapter_134	
chapter_134	aye and all splinter to piece stubb!--d'ye see -PRON-

chapter_135	and still this hair be grow now this moment grow and heat must breed -PRON-
chapter_135	in every fight -PRON- have the last and bitter blow
chapter_135	run tilting at -PRON- and -PRON- but run through -PRON-
chapter_135	even ahab be a brave thing a noble thing than that
chapter_135	these same trades that so directly blow -PRON- good ship on these trades or something like -PRON- something so unchangeable and full as strong blow -PRON- keeled soul along

chapter_135	steering as -PRON- have do the wind have be somewhat on the pequod 's quarter so that now be point in the reverse direction the brace ship sail hard upon the breeze as -PRON- rechurn the cream in -PRON- own white wake
chapter_135	-PRON- misdoubt -PRON- that -PRON- disobey -PRON- god in obey -PRON-
chapter_135	but let -PRON- have one more good round look aloft here at the sea there be time for that
chapter_135	there be a soft shower to leeward

chapter_135	see
chapter_135	crush thirty foot upwards the water flash for an instant like heap of fountain then brokenly sink in a shower of flake leave the circle surface cream like new milk round the marble trunk of the whale
chapter_135	while daggoo and queequeg be stop the strained plank and as the whale swimming out from -PRON- turn and show one entire flank as -PRON- shoot by -PRON- again at that moment a quick cry go up
chapter_135	lash round and round to the fish 's back pinion in the turn upon turn in which during the past night the whale have reel the involution of the line around -PRON- the half tear body of the parsee be see -PRON- sable raiment fray to shred -PRON- distended eye turn full upon old ahab
chapter_135	but -PRON- hold thee to the last letter of thy word
chapter_135	ye be not other man but -PRON- arm and -PRON- leg and so obey -PRON-
chapter_135	ahab cry starbuck not too late be -PRON- even now the third day to desist
chapter_135	-PRON- be thou thou that madly seekest -PRON-
chapter_135	and at last when ahab be slide by the vessel so near as plainly to distinguish starbuck 's face as -PRON- lean over the rail -PRON- hail -PRON- to turn the vessel about and follow -PRON- not too swiftly at a judicious interval
chapter_135	pull
chapter_135	the whale
chapter_135	slope downward to thy depth o sea that ere -PRON- be for ever too late ahab may slide this last last time upon -PRON- mark
chapter_135	but as the oarsman violently force -PRON- boat through the sledge hammer sea the before whale smite bow end of two plank burst through and in an instant almost the temporarily disabled boat lie nearly level with the wave -PRON- half wad splash crew try hard to stop the gap and bale out the pour water

chapter_135	next instant the heavy eye splice in the rope 's final end fly out of the stark empty tub knock down an oarsman and smite the sea disappear in -PRON- depth
chapter_135	now small fowl fly scream over the yet yawn gulf a sullen white surf beat against -PRON- steep side then all collapse and the great shroud of the sea roll on as -PRON- roll five thousand year ago
chapter_135	on the second day a sail draw near nearer and pick -PRON- up at last
