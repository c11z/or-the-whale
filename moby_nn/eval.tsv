chapter_24	in the first place -PRON- may be deem almost superfluous to establish the fact that among people at large the business of whaling be not account on a level with what be call the liberal profession
chapter_24	and as for the matter of the alleged uncleanliness of -PRON- business ye shall soon be initiate into certain fact hitherto pretty generally unknown and which upon the whole will triumphantly plant the sperm whale ship at least among the cleanly thing of this tidy earth
chapter_24	but even grant the charge in question to be true what disorder slippery deck of a whale ship be comparable to the unspeakable carrion of those battle field from which so many soldier return to drink in all lady plaudit
chapter_24	for what be the comprehensible terror of man compare with the interlinked terror and wonder of god
chapter_24	-PRON- be the whaleman who first break through the jealous policy of the spanish crown touch those colony and if space permit -PRON- may be distinctly show how from those whaleman at last eventuate the liberation of peru chili and bolivia from the yoke of old spain and the establishment of the eternal democracy in those part

chapter_24	the whale have no famous author and whale no famous chronicler -PRON- will say
chapter_24	who but mighty job
chapter_24	true enough but then whalemen -PRON- be poor devil -PRON- have no good blood in -PRON- vein
chapter_24	good again but then all confess that somehow whaling be not respectable
chapter_24	
chapter_24	cetus be a constellation in the south
chapter_25	but the only thing to be consider here be this what kind of oil be use at coronation
chapter_26	transport to the indies -PRON- live blood would not spoil like bottled ale
chapter_26	-PRON- pure tight skin be an excellent fit and closely wrap up in -PRON- and embalm with inner health and strength like a revivified egyptian this starbuck seem prepared to endure for long age to come and to endure always as now for be -PRON- polar snow or torrid sun like a patent chronometer -PRON- interior vitality be warrant to do well in all climate
chapter_26	look into -PRON- eye -PRON- seem to see there the yet linger image of those thousand fold peril -PRON- have calmly confront through life
chapter_26	that immaculate manliness -PRON- feel within -PRON- so far within -PRON- that -PRON- remain intact though all the outer character seem go bleed with keen anguish at the undraped spectacle of a valor ruin man

chapter_26	thou who didst pick up andrew jackson from the pebble who didst hurl -PRON- upon a war horse who didst thunder -PRON- higher than a throne
chapter_27	next be tashtego an unmixed indian from gay head the most westerly promontory of martha 's vineyard where there still exist the last remnant of a village of red man which have long supply the neighbor island of nantucket with many of -PRON- most daring harpooneer
chapter_27	third among the harpooneer be daggoo a gigantic coal black negro savage with a lion like tread an ahasuerus to behold
chapter_27	an anacharsis clootz deputation from all the isle of the sea and all the end of the earth accompany old ahab in the pequod to lay the world 's grievance before that bar from which not very many of -PRON- ever come back
chapter_28	for though the harpooneer with the great body of the crew be a far more barbaric heathenish and motley set than any of the tame merchant ship company which -PRON- previous experience have make -PRON- acquaint with still -PRON- ascribe this and rightly ascribe -PRON- to the fierce uniqueness of the very nature of that wild scandinavian vocation in which -PRON- have so abandonedly embark
chapter_28	but -PRON- be especially the aspect of the three chief officer of the ship the mate which be most forcibly calculate to allay these colourless misgiving and induce confidence and cheerfulness in every presentment of the voyage
chapter_28	now -PRON- be christmas when the ship shoot from out -PRON- harbor for a space -PRON- have bite polar weather though all the time run away from -PRON- to the southward and by every degree and minute of latitude which -PRON- sail gradually leave that merciless winter and all -PRON- intolerable weather behind -PRON-
chapter_28	by some tacit consent throughout the voyage little or no allusion be make to -PRON- especially by the mate
chapter_28	yet this wild hint seem inferentially negative by what a grey manxman insinuate an old sepulchral man who have never before sail out of nantucket have never ere this lay eye upon wild ahab
chapter_28	nevertheless the old sea tradition the immemorial credulity popularly invest this old manxman with preternatural power of discernment
chapter_28	so that no white sailor seriously contradict -PRON- when -PRON- say that if ever captain ahab should be tranquilly lay out which may hardly come to pass so -PRON- mutter then whoever should do that last office for the dead would find a birth mark on -PRON- from crown to sole
chapter_28	and not only that but moody stricken ahab stand before -PRON- with a crucifixion in -PRON- face in all the nameless regal overbearing dignity of some mighty woe
chapter_28	nevertheless ere long the warm warble persuasiveness of the pleasant holiday weather -PRON- come to seem gradually to charm -PRON- from -PRON- mood
chapter_28	for as when the red cheeked dance girl april and may trip home to the wintry misanthropic wood even the bare rugged most thunder cleave old oak will at least send forth some few green sprout to welcome such glad hearted visitant so ahab do in the end a little respond to the playful alluring of that girlish air

chapter_33	at present -PRON- rank simply as senior harpooneer and as such be but one of the captain 's more inferior subaltern
chapter_33	that be to say -PRON- take -PRON- meal in the captain 's cabin and sleep in a place indirectly communicate with -PRON-

chapter_34	when the last echo of -PRON- sultan 's step have die away and starbuck the first emir have every reason to suppose that -PRON- be seat then starbuck rouse from -PRON- quietude take a few turn along the plank and after a grave peep into the binnacle say with some touch of pleasantness dinner mr. stubb and descend the scuttle
chapter_34	-PRON- be as little child before ahab and yet in ahab there seem not to lurk the small social arrogance

chapter_41	in that way mostly the disastrous encounter between ahab and the whale have hitherto be popularly regard
chapter_41	and as the sea surpass the land in this matter so the whale fishery surpass every other sort of maritime life in the wonderfulness and fearfulness of the rumor which sometimes circulate there
chapter_41	alone in such remote water that though -PRON- sail a thousand mile and pass a thousand shore -PRON- would not come to any chiseled hearth stone or aught hospitable beneath that part of the sun in such latitude and longitude pursue too such a call as -PRON- do the whaleman be wrap by influence all tend to make -PRON- fancy pregnant with many a mighty birth
chapter_41	there be those this day among -PRON- who though intelligent and courageous enough in offer battle to the greenland or right whale would perhaps either from professional inexperience or incompetency or timidity decline a contest with the sperm whale at any rate there be plenty of whaleman especially among those whaling nation not sailing under the american flag who have never hostilely encounter the sperm whale but whose sole knowledge of the leviathan be restrict to the ignoble monster primitively pursue in the north seat on -PRON- hatch these man will hearken with a childish fireside interest and awe to the wild strange tale of southern whaling
chapter_41	on this head there be some remarkable document that may be consult
chapter_41	for when swimming before -PRON- exult pursuer with every apparent symptom of alarm -PRON- have several time be know to turn round suddenly and bear down upon -PRON- either stave -PRON- boat to splinter or drive -PRON- back in consternation to -PRON- ship
chapter_41	-PRON- be not probable that this monomania in -PRON- take -PRON- instant rise at the precise time of -PRON- bodily dismemberment
chapter_41	yet when by this collision force to turn towards home and for long month of day and week ahab and anguish lay stretch together in one hammock round in mid winter that dreary howl patagonian cape then -PRON- be that -PRON- tear body and gashed soul bleed into one another and so interfus make -PRON- mad
chapter_41	human madness be oftentimes a cunning and most feline thing
chapter_41	that before live agent now become the live instrument
chapter_41	this be much yet ahab 's large dark deep part remain unhint
chapter_41	wind far down from within the very heart of this spiked hotel de cluny where -PRON- here stand however grand and wonderful now quit -PRON- and take -PRON- way ye noble sad soul to those vast roman hall of thermes where far beneath the fantastic tower of man 's upper earth -PRON- root of grandeur -PRON- whole awful essence sit in bearded state an antique bury beneath antiquity and throned on torsoe
chapter_42	what the white whale be to ahab have be hint what at time -PRON- be to -PRON- as yet remain unsaid
chapter_42	
chapter_42	-PRON- peep to secret which take hold of god
chapter_42	long -PRON- gaze at that prodigy of plumage
chapter_42	but at last -PRON- awake and turn ask a sailor what bird be this
chapter_42	so that by no possibility could coleridge 's wild rhyme have have aught to do with those mystical impression which be -PRON- when -PRON- see that bird upon -PRON- deck
chapter_42	can -PRON- then by the citation of some of those instance wherein this thing of whiteness though for the time either wholly or in great part strip of all direct association calculate to impart to -PRON- aught fearful but nevertheless be find to exert over -PRON- the same sorcery however modify can -PRON- thus hope to light upon some chance clue to conduct -PRON- to the hide because -PRON- seek
chapter_42	or why irrespective of all latitude and longitude do the name of the white sea exert such a spectralness over the fancy while that of the yellow sea lull -PRON- with mortal thought of long lacquer mild afternoon on the wave follow by the gaudy and yet sleepy of sunset
chapter_42	to the native indian of peru the continual sight of the snowhowdah andes convey naught of dread except perhaps in the mere fancying of the eternal frost desolateness reign at such vast altitude and the natural conceit of what a fearfulness -PRON- would be to lose oneself in such inhuman solitude
chapter_43	do -PRON- hear that noise cabaco
chapter_43	-PRON- be the middle watch a fair moonlight the seaman be stand in a cordon extend from one of the fresh water butt in the waist to the scuttle butt near the taffrail
chapter_43	take the bucket will ye archy
chapter_43	
chapter_44	have -PRON- follow captain ahab down into -PRON- cabin after the squall that take place on the night succeed that wild ratification of -PRON- purpose with -PRON- crew -PRON- would have see -PRON- go to a locker in the transom and bring out a large wrinkled roll of yellowish sea chart spread -PRON- before -PRON- on -PRON- screw down table
chapter_44	and hence not only at substantiate time upon well know separate feeding ground could ahab hope to encounter -PRON- prey but in cross the wide expanse of water between those ground -PRON- could by -PRON- art so place and time -PRON- on -PRON- way as even then not to be wholly without prospect of a meeting
chapter_44	-PRON- broad fin be bored and scallop out like a lost sheep 's ear
chapter_44	ah god
chapter_44	the latter be the eternal live principle or soul in -PRON- and in sleep be for the time dissociate from the characterize mind which at other time employ -PRON- for -PRON- outer vehicle or agent -PRON- spontaneously seek escape from the scorching contiguity of the frantic thing of which for the time -PRON- be no longer an integral
chapter_45	first -PRON- have personally know three instance where a whale after receive a harpoon have effect a complete escape and after an interval in one instance of three year have be again strike by the same hand and slay when the two iron both mark by the same private cypher have be take from the body
chapter_45	yet -PRON- tell -PRON- that upon one particular voyage which -PRON- make to the pacific among many other -PRON- speak thirty different ship every one of which have have a death by a whale some of -PRON- more than one and three that have each lose a boat 's crew
chapter_45	very good but there be more coming
chapter_45	by the thirteenth of may -PRON- ship be ready to sail and the next day -PRON- be out in the open sea on -PRON- way to ochotsh
chapter_45	the weather be very clear and fine but so intolerably cold that -PRON- be oblige to keep on -PRON- fur clothing
chapter_45	for some day -PRON- have very little wind -PRON- be not till the nineteenth that a brisk gale from the northwest spring up
chapter_45	lionel -PRON- seem be on -PRON- way to john ferdinando as -PRON- call the modern juan fernandes
chapter_45	captain davis who lie with -PRON- head on a gun be throw out of -PRON- cabin
chapter_45	in more than one instance -PRON- have be know not only to chase the assail boat back to -PRON- ship but to pursue the ship -PRON- and long withstand all the lance hurl at -PRON- from -PRON- deck
chapter_45	but -PRON- must be content with only one more and a conclude illustration a remarkable and most significant one by which -PRON- will not fail to see that not only be the most marvellous event in this book corroborate by plain fact of the present day but that these marvel like all marvel be mere repetition of the age so that for the millionth time -PRON- say amen with solomon
chapter_45	in the propontis as far as -PRON- can learn none of that peculiar substance call brit be to be find the aliment of the right whale
chapter_45	but -PRON- have every reason to believe that the food of the sperm whale squid or cuttle fish lurk at the bottom of that sea because large creature but by no mean the large of that sort have be find at -PRON- surface
chapter_46	to accomplish -PRON- object ahab must use tool and of all tool use in the shadow of the moon man be most apt to get out of order
chapter_46	-PRON- may be that a long interval would elapse ere the white whale be see
chapter_46	in time of strong emotion mankind disdain all base consideration but such time be evanescent
chapter_47	the mat maker -PRON- be a cloudy sultry afternoon the seaman be lazily lounge about the deck or vacantly gaze over into the lead coloured water
chapter_47	-PRON- body be reach eagerly forward -PRON- hand stretch out like a wand and at brief sudden interval -PRON- continue -PRON- cry
chapter_47	tashtego report that the whale have go down head to leeward -PRON- confidently look to see -PRON- again directly in advance of -PRON- bow
chapter_48	the figure that now stand by -PRON- bow be tall and swart with one white tooth evilly protrude from -PRON- steel like lip
chapter_48	there -PRON- blow right ahead boys!--lay back
chapter_48	that be -PRON-
chapter_48	here whip out the sharp knife from -PRON- girdle every mother 's son of ye draw -PRON- knife and pull with the blade between -PRON- tooth
chapter_48	aye and that be what -PRON- go into the after hold for so often as dough boy long suspect
chapter_48	the white whale 's at the bottom of -PRON-
chapter_48	now the advent of these outlandish stranger at such a critical instant as the lowering of the boat from the deck this have not unreasonably awaken a sort of superstitious amazement in some of the ship 's company but archy 's fancy discovery have some time previous get abroad among -PRON- though indeed not credit then this have in some small measure prepare -PRON- for the event
chapter_48	whereupon plant -PRON- foot firmly against two opposite plank of the boat the gigantic negro stoop a little present -PRON- flat palm to flask 's foot and then put flask 's hand on -PRON- hearse plumed head and bid -PRON- spring as -PRON- -PRON- should toss with one dexterous fling land the little man high and dry on -PRON- shoulder
chapter_48	still more strange to see
chapter_48	-PRON- withdraw -PRON- from -PRON- hatband where -PRON- always wear -PRON- aslant like a feather
chapter_48	roar and pull -PRON- thunderbolt
chapter_48	and so shouting -PRON- pull -PRON- hat from -PRON- head and stamp up and down on -PRON- then pick -PRON- up flirt -PRON- far off upon the sea and finally fall to rearing and plunge in the boat 's stern like a crazed colt from the prairie
chapter_48	crack all -PRON- backbone and bite -PRON- knife in two
chapter_48	give way man whisper starbuck draw still further aft the sheet of -PRON- sail there be time to kill a fish yet before the squall come
chapter_48	a short rush sound leap out of the boat -PRON- be the dart iron of queequeg
chapter_48	meanwhile the drive scud rack and mist grow dark with the shadow of night no sign of the ship could be see
chapter_48	the rise sea forbid all attempt to bale out the boat
chapter_49	there be nothing like the peril of whaling to breed this free and easy sort of genial desperado philosophy and with -PRON- -PRON- now regard this whole voyage of the pequod and the great white whale -PRON- object
chapter_49	will -PRON- tell -PRON- whether -PRON- be an unalterable law in this fishery mr. flask for an oarsman to break -PRON- own back pull -PRON- back foremost into death 's jaw
chapter_49	can not -PRON- twist that small say flask
chapter_49	-PRON- survive -PRON- -PRON- death and burial be lock up in -PRON- chest
chapter_51	there -PRON- blow
chapter_51	have the trump of judgment blow -PRON- could not have quiver more yet still -PRON- feel no terror rather pleasure
chapter_51	and have -PRON- watch ahab 's face that night -PRON- would have think that in -PRON- also two different thing be war
chapter_51	these temporary apprehension so vague but so awful derive a wondrous potency from the contrast serenity of the weather in which beneath all -PRON- blue blandness some thought there lurk a devilish charm as for day and day -PRON- voyage along through sea so wearily lonesomely mild that all space in repugnance to -PRON- vengeful errand seem vacate -PRON- of life before -PRON- urn like prow
chapter_51	even when wearied nature seem demand repose -PRON- would not seek that repose in -PRON- hammock
chapter_51	on the table beside -PRON- lie unroll one of those chart of tide and current which have previously be speak of
chapter_52	only -PRON- low sail be set
chapter_52	a wild sight -PRON- be to see -PRON- long bearded look out at those three mast head
chapter_53	the gam
chapter_53	but even have this not be the case -PRON- would not after all perhaps have board -PRON- judge by -PRON- subsequent conduct on similar occasion if so -PRON- have be that by the process of hail -PRON- have obtain a negative answer to the question -PRON- put
chapter_53	but where this superiority in the english whalemen do really consist -PRON- would be hard to say see that the yankees in one day collectively kill more whale than all the english collectively in ten year
chapter_53	as touch slave ship meeting why -PRON- be in such a prodigious hurry -PRON- run away from each other as soon as possible
chapter_53	because in the case of pirate say -PRON- should like to know whether that profession of -PRON- have any peculiar glory about -PRON-
chapter_53	dr. johnson never attain to that erudition noah webster 's ark do not hold -PRON-
chapter_53	the two captain remaining for the time on board of one ship and the two chief mate on the other
chapter_53	and often -PRON- will notice that be conscious of the eye of the whole visible world rest on -PRON- from the side of the two ship this stand captain be all alive to the importance of sustain -PRON- dignity by maintain -PRON- leg
chapter_53	-PRON- be thus completely wedge before and behind and can only expand -PRON- sideways by settle down on -PRON- stretched leg but a sudden violent pitch of the boat will often go far to topple -PRON- because length of foundation be nothing without correspond breadth
chapter_54	on the eastern shore of -PRON- lake erie don but
chapter_54	much this way have -PRON- be with the town ho so when -PRON- leak be find gain once more there be in truth some small concern manifest by several of -PRON- company especially by radney the mate
chapter_54	and then without at all allude to the shovel -PRON- point to three lad as the customary sweeper who not be billet at the pump have do little or nothing all day
chapter_54	-PRON- have see many whale ship in -PRON- harbour but never hear of -PRON- canallers
chapter_54	there be -PRON- true ashantee gentleman there howl -PRON- pagan where -PRON- ever find -PRON- next door to -PRON- under the long flung shadow and the snug patronising lee of church

chapter_54	once a vagabond on -PRON- own canal -PRON- have receive good turn from one of these canallers -PRON- thank -PRON- heartily would fain be not ungrateful but -PRON- be often one of the prime redeem quality of -PRON- man of violence that at time -PRON- have as stiff an arm to back a poor stranger in a strait as to plunder a wealthy one
chapter_54	hardly have -PRON- do so when -PRON- be surround by the three junior mate and the four harpooneer who all crowd -PRON- to the deck
chapter_54	look to those handspike -PRON- heartie
chapter_54	shall -PRON- cry the ringleader to -PRON- man
chapter_54	water be then lower down to -PRON- and a couple of handful of biscuit be toss after -PRON- when again turn the key upon -PRON- and pocket -PRON- the captain return to the quarter deck
chapter_54	shut -PRON- up again will ye
chapter_54	cry steelkilt
chapter_54	oh certainly the captain and the key click
chapter_54	-PRON- be at this point gentleman that enrage by the defection of seven of -PRON- former associate and sting by the mock voice that have last hail -PRON- and madden by -PRON- long entombment in a place as black as the bowel of despair -PRON- be then that steelkilt propose to the two canallers thus far apparently of one mind with -PRON- to burst out of -PRON- hole at the next summoning of the garrison and arm with -PRON- keen mince knife long crescentic heavy implement with a handle at each end run amuck from the bowsprit to the taffrail and if by any devilishness of desperation possible seize the ship
chapter_54	upon hear the frantic project of -PRON- leader each in -PRON- own separate soul have suddenly light -PRON- would seem upon the same piece of treachery namely to be foremost in break out in order to be the first of the three though the last of the ten to surrender and thereby secure whatev small chance of pardon such conduct may merit
chapter_54	but when steelkilt make know -PRON- determination still to lead -PRON- to the last -PRON- in some way by some subtle chemistry of villany mix -PRON- before secret treachery together and when -PRON- leader fall into a doze verbally open -PRON- soul to each other in three sentence and bind the sleeper with cord and gag -PRON- with cord and shriek out for the captain at midnight think murder at hand and smell in the dark for the blood -PRON- and all -PRON- armed mate and harpooneer rush for the forecastle
chapter_54	-PRON- cry at last but there be still rope enough leave for -PRON- -PRON- fine bantam that would not give up
chapter_54	good not hiss the lakeman
chapter_54	steelkilt here hiss out something inaudible to all but the captain who to the amazement of all hand start back pace the deck rapidly two or three time and then suddenly throw down -PRON- rope say -PRON- will not do -PRON- let -PRON- go cut -PRON- down d'ye hear
chapter_54	but as the junior mate be hurry to execute the order a pale man with a bandage head arrest -PRON-
chapter_54	the three man be then cut down all hand be turn to and sullenly work by the moody seaman the iron pump clang as before
chapter_54	there be a considerable vacancy between the boat and the ship and down between this be the sea
chapter_54	shipmate -PRON- have not enough twine have -PRON- any

chapter_55	-PRON- doubt not the captain have this veracious picture take for the benefit of -PRON- marine
chapter_55	but these manifold mistake in depict the whale be not so very surprising after all
chapter_55	the live whale in -PRON- full majesty and significance be only to be see at sea in unfathomable water and afloat the vast bulk of -PRON- be out of sight like a launched line of battle ship and out of that element -PRON- be a thing eternally impossible for mortal man to hoist -PRON- bodily into the air so as to preserve all -PRON- mighty swell and undulation
chapter_56	all beale 's drawing of this whale be good except the middle figure in the picture of three whale in various attitude cap -PRON- second chapter
chapter_56	serious fault may be find with the anatomical detail of this whale but let that pass since for the life of -PRON- -PRON- could not draw so good a one
chapter_56	in the second engraving the boat be in the act of draw alongside the barnacled flank of a large running right whale that roll -PRON- black weedy bulk in the sea like some mossy rock slide from the patagonian cliff
chapter_56	from the ship the smoke of the torment of the boil whale be go up like the smoke over a village of smithy and to windward a black cloud rise up with earnest of squall and rain seem to quicken the activity of the excited seaman
chapter_57	on tower hill as -PRON- go down to the london dock -PRON- may have see a crippled beggar or kedger as the sailor say hold a painted board before -PRON- represent the tragic scene in which -PRON- lose -PRON- leg
chapter_57	some of -PRON- have little box of dentistical look implement specially intend for the skrimshander business
chapter_58	but -PRON- be only the sound -PRON- make as -PRON- part the brit which at all remind one of mower
chapter_58	for though some old naturalist have maintain that all creature of the land be of -PRON- kind in the sea and though take a broad general view of the thing this may very well be yet come to specialty where for example do the ocean furnish any fish that in disposition answer to the sagacious kindness of the dog
chapter_58	yea foolish mortal noah 's flood be not yet subside two third of the fair world -PRON- yet cover
chapter_58	wherein differ the sea and the land that a miracle upon one be not a miracle upon the other
chapter_59	there again
chapter_59	the four boat be soon on the water ahab 's in advance and all swiftly pull towards -PRON- prey
chapter_59	but much abatement be necessary with respect to the incredible bulk -PRON- assign -PRON-
chapter_60	hemp be a dusky dark fellow a sort of indian but manilla be as a golden haired circassian to behold
chapter_60	at first sight -PRON- would not think -PRON- so strong as -PRON- really be
chapter_60	first in order to facilitate the fastening to -PRON- of an additional line from a neighbor boat in case the stricken whale should sound so deep as to threaten to carry off the entire line originally attach to the harpoon
chapter_60	second this arrangement be indispensable for common safety 's sake for be the low end of the line in any way attach to the boat and be the whale then to run the line out to the end almost in a single smoking minute as -PRON- sometimes do -PRON- would not stop there for the doomed boat would infallibly be drag down after -PRON- into the profundity of the sea and in that case no town crier would ever find -PRON- again
chapter_61	no resolution could withstand -PRON- in that dreamy mood lose all consciousness at last -PRON- soul go out of -PRON- body though -PRON- body still continue to sway as a pendulum will long after the power which first move -PRON- be withdraw
chapter_61	ere forgetfulness altogether come over -PRON- -PRON- have notice that the seaman at the main and mizzen mast head be already drowsy
chapter_61	the wave too nod -PRON- indolent crest and across the wide trance of the sea east nod to west and the sun over all
chapter_61	close under -PRON- lee not forty fathom off a gigantic sperm whale lie roll in the water like the capsize hull of a frigate -PRON- broad glossy back of an ethiopian hue glisten in the sun 's ray like a mirror
chapter_61	presently as -PRON- thus glide in chase the monster perpendicularly flit -PRON- tail forty foot into the air and then sink out of sight like a tower swallow up
chapter_61	-PRON- will be see in some other place of what a very light substance the entire interior of the sperm whale 's enormous head consist
chapter_61	wa hee scream the gay header in reply raise some old war whoop to the sky as every oarsman in the strained boat involuntarily bounce forward with the one tremendous lead stroke which the eager indian give
chapter_61	meanwhile stubb retain -PRON- place in the van still encourage -PRON- man to the onset all the while puff the smoke from -PRON- mouth
chapter_61	stern all
chapter_61	stubb have swiftly catch two additional turn with -PRON- round
chapter_61	wet the line
chapter_61	the boat now fly through the boil water like a shark all fin
chapter_61	from the vibrate line extend the entire length of the upper part of the boat and from -PRON- now be more tight than a harpstring -PRON- would have think the craft have two keel one cleave the water the other the air as the boat churn on through both oppose element at once
chapter_61	-PRON- tormented body roll not in brine but in blood which bubble and seethe for furlong behind in -PRON- wake
chapter_61	pull up!--close to
chapter_62	-PRON- know that this would sometimes involve a slight loss of speed in the chase but long experience in various whaleman of more than one nation have convince -PRON- that in the vast majority of failure in the fishery -PRON- have not by any mean be so much the speed of the whale as the before describe exhaustion of the harpooneer that have cause -PRON-
chapter_63	the crotch
chapter_63	-PRON- be customary to have two harpoon repose in the crotch respectively call the first and second iron
chapter_63	but -PRON- very often happen that owe to the instantaneous violent convulsive running of the whale upon receive the first iron -PRON- become impossible for the harpooneer however lightning like in -PRON- movement to pitch the second iron into -PRON-
chapter_63	but this critical act be not always unattended with the sad and most fatal casualty
chapter_63	for of course each boat be supply with several harpoon to bend on to the line should the first one be ineffectually dart without recovery
chapter_64	stubb 's supper
chapter_64	darkness come on but three light up and down in the pequod 's main rigging dimly guide -PRON- way till draw nearer -PRON- see ahab drop one of several more lantern over the bulwark
chapter_64	but by those clank link the vast corpse -PRON- not the ship be to be moor
chapter_64	there be those shark now over the side do not -PRON- see -PRON- prefer -PRON- tough and rare
chapter_64	here take this lantern snatch one from -PRON- sideboard now then go and preach to -PRON-
chapter_64	-PRON- hear
chapter_64	hind de hatchway in ferry boat go ober de roanoke
chapter_64	-PRON- cry sharply
chapter_64	no -PRON- do not cook but -PRON- will tell -PRON- what -PRON- be come to cook
chapter_64	
chapter_64	
chapter_64	drop -PRON- tong cook and hear -PRON- order
chapter_64	hold -PRON- hat in one hand and clap t'other a'top of -PRON- heart when -PRON- be give -PRON- order cook
chapter_64	cook give -PRON- cutlet for supper to morrow night in the mid watch
chapter_65	-PRON- be upon record that three century ago the tongue of the right whale be esteem a great delicacy in france and command large price there
chapter_65	-PRON- tell -PRON- -PRON- will be more tolerable for the fejee that salt down a lean missionary in -PRON- cellar against a come famine -PRON- will be more tolerable for that provident fejee -PRON- say in the day of judgment than for thee civilized and enlightened gourmand who nailest goose to the ground and feastest on -PRON- bloated liver in thy pate de foie gras
chapter_65	but stubb -PRON- eat the whale by -PRON- own light do -PRON-
chapter_65	and with what quill do the secretary of the society for the suppression of cruelty to gander formally indite -PRON- circular
chapter_66	nevertheless upon stubb set the anchor watch after -PRON- supper be conclude and when accordingly queequeg and a forecastle seaman come on deck no small excitement be create among the shark for immediately suspend the cut stage over the side and lower three lantern so that -PRON- cast long gleam of light over the turbid sea these two mariner dart -PRON- long whaling spade keep up an incessant murdering of the shark by strike the keen steel deep into -PRON- skull seemingly -PRON- only vital part
chapter_66	nor be this all
chapter_67	the ivory pequod be turn into what seem a shamble every sailor a butcher
chapter_67	this do a broad semicircular line be cut round the hole the hook be insert and the main body of the crew strike up a wild chorus now commence heaving in one dense crowd at the windlass
chapter_67	into this twilight apartment sundry nimble hand keep coil away the long blanket piece as if -PRON- be a great live mass of plaited serpent
chapter_68	-PRON- have several such dry bit which -PRON- use for mark in -PRON- whale book
chapter_68	-PRON- be transparent as -PRON- say before and be lay upon the print page -PRON- have sometimes please -PRON- with fancy -PRON- exert a magnifying influence
chapter_68	this allusion to the indian rock remind -PRON- of another thing
chapter_68	a word or two more concern this matter of the skin or blubber of the whale
chapter_68	do thou too remain warm among ice
chapter_69	for hour and hour from the almost stationary ship that hideous sight be see
chapter_70	better and good man
chapter_71	here be -PRON- say that like the vessel of military marine the ship of the american whale fleet have each a private signal all which signal be collect in a book with the name of the respective vessel attach every captain be provide with -PRON-
chapter_71	-PRON- engage -PRON- but straightway upon the ship be get out of sight of land -PRON- insanity break out in a freshet
chapter_71	
chapter_71	-PRON- become a nameless terror to the ship
chapter_71	aye aye -PRON- be but
chapter_71	captain mayhew stand by now to receive -PRON- and take the fatal missive from starbuck 's hand -PRON- catch -PRON- in the slit of the pole and reach -PRON- over towards the boat
chapter_71	-PRON- clutch -PRON- in an instant seize the boat knife and impale the letter on -PRON- send -PRON- thus load back into the ship
chapter_72	in the tumultuous business of cut in and attend to a whale there be much run backwards and forwards among the crew
chapter_72	queequeg be -PRON- own inseparable twin brother nor could -PRON- any way get rid of the dangerous liability which the hempen bond entail
chapter_72	if -PRON- banker break -PRON- snap if -PRON- apothecary by mistake send -PRON- poison in -PRON- pill -PRON- die
chapter_72	this procedure of -PRON- to be sure be very disinterested and benevolent of -PRON-
chapter_72	but courage
chapter_72	no hand -PRON- ye god
chapter_72	suspiciously ask stubb come near
chapter_72	ginger be ginger the sort of fuel -PRON- use dough boy to kindle a fire in this shiver cannibal
chapter_72	
chapter_73	cut cut be the cry from the ship to the boat which for one instant seem on the point of be bring with a deadly dash against the vessel 's side
chapter_73	-PRON- wonder what the old man want with this lump of foul lard say stubb not without some disgust at the thought of have to do with so ignoble a leviathan
chapter_73	flask point into the sea with a peculiar motion of both
chapter_73	why -PRON- say as how -PRON- go a sauntering into the old flag ship once switch -PRON- tail about devilish easy and gentlemanlike and inquire if the old governor be at home
chapter_73	well -PRON- be at home and ask the devil what -PRON- want
chapter_73	but now tell -PRON- stubb do -PRON- suppose that that devil -PRON- be speak of just now be the same -PRON- say be now on board the pequod
chapter_73	now if -PRON- be so old as all those hoop of -PRON- come to and if -PRON- be go to live for ever what good will -PRON- do to pitch -PRON- overboard tell -PRON- that give -PRON- a good ducking anyhow
chapter_73	so -PRON- suppose -PRON- be afraid of the devil
chapter_73	but -PRON- be go now to keep a sharp look out on -PRON- and if -PRON- see anything very suspicious go on -PRON- will just take -PRON- by the nape of -PRON- neck and say
chapter_73	
chapter_73	say flask yes -PRON- will soon see this right whale 's head hoist up opposite that parmacetti 's
chapter_73	as before the pequod steeply lean over towards the sperm whale 's head now by the counterpoise of both head -PRON- regain -PRON- even keel though sorely strained -PRON- may well believe
chapter_73	as the crew toil on laplandish speculation be bandy among -PRON- concern all these pass thing
chapter_74	as the external difference between -PRON- be mainly observable in -PRON- head and as a head of each be this moment hang from the pequod 's side and as -PRON- may freely go from one to the other by merely step across the deck where -PRON- should like to know will -PRON- obtain a good chance to study practical cetology than here
chapter_74	as -PRON- behold -PRON- -PRON- involuntarily yield the immense superiority to -PRON- in point of pervade dignity
chapter_74	if -PRON- bitter foe be walk straight towards -PRON- with dagger uplifted in broad day -PRON- would not be able to see -PRON- any more than if -PRON- be steal upon -PRON- from behind
chapter_74	but with the whale these two sash be separately insert make two distinct window but sadly impair the view
chapter_74	a curious and most puzzling question may be start concern this visual matter as touch the leviathan
chapter_74	so long as a man 's eye be open in the light the act of seeing be involuntary that is -PRON- can not then help mechanically see whatev object be before -PRON-
chapter_74	instant of time never mind if -PRON- lie side by side and touch each other
chapter_74	how be -PRON- then with the whale
chapter_74	if -PRON- can then be -PRON- as marvellous a thing in -PRON- as if a man be able simultaneously to go through the demonstration of two distinct problem in euclid
chapter_74	nor strictly investigate be there any incongruity in this comparison
chapter_74	be -PRON- not curious that so vast a being as the whale should see the world through so small an eye and hear the thunder through an ear which be small than a hare 's
chapter_74	but far more terrible be -PRON- to behold when fathom down in the sea -PRON- see some sulky whale float there suspend with -PRON- prodigious jaw some fifteen foot long hang straight down at right angle with -PRON- body for all the world like a ship 's jib boom
chapter_75	what a huge sulk and pout be there
chapter_75	in the central blind of bone as -PRON- stand in -PRON- natural order there be certain curious mark curve hollow and ridge whereby some whaleman calculate the creature 's age as the age of an oak by -PRON- circular ring
chapter_75	in old time there seem to have prevail the most curious fancy concern these blind
chapter_75	sometimes these tuft impart a rather brigandish expression to -PRON- otherwise solemn countenance
chapter_75	nor in the sperm whale be there any of those blind of bone no huge low lip and scarcely anything of a tongue
chapter_75	do not this whole head seem to speak of an enormous practical resolution in face death
chapter_76	wherefore -PRON- must now have perceive that the front of the sperm whale 's head be a dead blind wall without a single organ or tender prominence of any sort whatsoever
chapter_76	in some previous place -PRON- have describe to -PRON- how the blubber wrap the body of the whale as the rind wrap an orange
chapter_76	unerringly impel this dead impregnable uninjurable wall and this most buoyant thing within there swim behind -PRON- all a mass of tremendous life only to be adequately estimate as pile wood be by the cord and all obedient to one volition as the small insect
chapter_77	but to comprehend -PRON- aright -PRON- must know something of the curious internal structure of the thing operate upon
chapter_78	a short handle sharp spade be send up to -PRON- -PRON- diligently search for the proper place to begin break into the tun
chapter_78	by the time this cautious search be over a stout iron bind bucket precisely like a well bucket have be attach to one end of the whip while the other end be stretch across the deck be there hold by two or three alert hand
chapter_78	now the people of the pequod have be bale some time in this way several tub have be fill with the fragrant sperm when all at once a queer accident happen
chapter_78	the one remain hook upon which the entire strain now depend seem every instant to be on the point of give way an event still more likely from the violent motion of the head
chapter_78	avast
chapter_78	almost in the same instant with a thunder boom the enormous mass drop into the sea like niagara 's table rock into the whirlpool the suddenly relieve hull roll away from -PRON- to far down -PRON- glitter copper and all catch -PRON- breath as half swinging now over the sailor head and now over the water daggoo through a thick mist of spray be dimly behold cling to the pendulous tackle while poor bury alive tashtego be sink utterly down to the bottom of the sea
chapter_78	some hand now jump into a boat alongside and push a little off from the ship
chapter_78	cry daggoo all at once from -PRON- now quiet swing perch overhead and look further off from the side -PRON- see an arm thrust upright from the blue wave a sight strange to see as an arm thrust forth from the grass over a grave
chapter_78	
chapter_78	-PRON- think the tissue infiltrate head of the sperm whale be the light and most corky part about -PRON- and yet thou makest -PRON- sink in an element of a far great specific gravity than -PRON-
chapter_78	yes -PRON- be a run delivery so -PRON- be
chapter_79	for as in landscape gardening a spire cupola monument or tower of some sort be deem almost indispensable to the completion of the scene so no face can be physiognomically in keep without the elevated open work belfry of the nose
chapter_79	as on -PRON- physiognomical voyage -PRON- sail round -PRON- vast head in -PRON- jolly boat -PRON- noble conception of -PRON- be never insult by the reflection that -PRON- have a nose to be pull
chapter_79	human or animal the mystical brow be as that great golden seal affix by the german emperor to -PRON- decree
chapter_79	but in the great sperm whale this high and mighty god like dignity inherent in the brow be so immensely amplify that gaze on -PRON- in that full front view -PRON- feel the deity and the dread power more forcibly than in behold any other object in live nature
chapter_79	have the sperm whale ever write a book speak a speech
chapter_79	-PRON- be moreover declare in -PRON- pyramidical silence
chapter_79	-PRON- but put that brow before -PRON-
chapter_80	in the full grow creature the skull will measure at least twenty foot in length
chapter_80	but leave this hint to operate as -PRON- may with the phrenologist -PRON- would merely assume the spinal theory for a moment in reference to the sperm whale 's hump
chapter_81	-PRON- be all right be the yarman
chapter_81	-PRON- leave a great wide wake as though continually unroll a great wide parchment upon the sea full in this rapid wake and many fathom in the rear swim a huge humped old bull which by -PRON- comparatively slow progress as well as by the unusual yellowish incrustation overgrow -PRON- seem afflict with the jaundice or some other infirmity
chapter_81	-PRON- spout be short slow and laborious come forth with a choke sort of gush and spend -PRON- in torn shred follow by strange subterranean commotion in -PRON- which seem to have egress at -PRON- other bury extremity cause the water behind -PRON- to upbubble
chapter_81	mind -PRON- do not sling thee with -PRON- cry starbuck
chapter_81	oh do pile on the beef lay like a log
chapter_81	tashtego be -PRON- the man to snap -PRON- spine in two and twenty piece for the honour of old gayhead
chapter_81	now to this hand now to that -PRON- yaw in -PRON- faltering flight and still at every billow that -PRON- break -PRON- spasmodically sink in the sea or sideways roll towards the sky -PRON- one beat fin
chapter_81	but the bird have a voice and with plaintive cry will make know -PRON- fear but the fear of this vast dumb brute of the sea be chain up and enchant in -PRON- -PRON- have no voice save that choke respiration through -PRON- spiracle and this make the sight of -PRON- unspeakably pitiable while still in -PRON- amazing bulk portcullis jaw and omnipotent tail there be enough to appal the stout man who so pity
chapter_81	do not be afraid -PRON- butter box cry stubb cast a pass glance upon -PRON- as -PRON- shoot by ye'll be pick up presently all right -PRON- see some shark astern st
chapter_81	because owe to the enormous surface of -PRON- in a full grown sperm whale something less than 2000 square foot the pressure of the water be immense
chapter_81	to three bit of board
chapter_81	avast cry starbuck there be no need of that
chapter_81	for by this time so spend be -PRON- by loss of blood that -PRON- helplessly roll away from the wreck -PRON- have make lay pant on -PRON- side impotently flap with -PRON- stumped fin then over and over slowly revolve like a wan world turn up the white secret of -PRON- belly lie like a log and die
chapter_81	-PRON- be most piteous that last expire spout
chapter_81	as when by unseen hand the water be gradually draw off from some mighty fountain and with half stifle melancholy gurgling the spray column lower and lower to the ground so the last long die spout of the whale
chapter_81	immediately by starbuck 's order line be secure to -PRON- at different point so that ere long every boat be a buoy the sunken whale be suspend a few inch beneath -PRON- by the cord
chapter_81	but still more curious be the fact of a lance head of stone be find in -PRON- not far from the bury iron the flesh perfectly firm about -PRON-
chapter_81	who have dart that stone lance
chapter_81	what other marvel may have be rummage out of this monstrous cabinet
chapter_81	usually the dead sperm whale float with great buoyancy with -PRON- side or belly considerably elevate above the surface
chapter_82	those be the knightly day of -PRON- profession when -PRON- only bear arm to succor the distressed and not to fill man 's lamp feeder
chapter_82	and let no man doubt this arkite story for in the ancient joppa now jaffa on the syrian coast in one of the pagan temple there stand for many age the vast skeleton of a whale which the city 's legend and all the inhabitant assert to be the identical bone of the monster that perseus slew
chapter_82	let not the modern painting of this scene mislead -PRON- for though the creature encounter by that valiant whaleman of old be vaguely represent of a griffin like shape and though the battle be depict on land and the saint on horseback yet consider the great ignorance of those time when the true form of the whale be unknown to artist and consider that as in perseus case st. george 's whale may have crawl up out of the sea on the beach and consider that the animal ride by st. george may have be only a large seal or sea horse bear all this in mind -PRON- will not appear altogether incompatible with the sacred legend and the ancient draught of the scene to hold this so call dragon no other than the great leviathan -PRON-
chapter_82	in fact place before the strict and pierce truth this whole story will fare like that fish flesh and fowl idol of the philistines dagon by name who be plant before the ark of israel -PRON- horse 's head and both the palm of -PRON- hand fall off from -PRON- and only the stump or fishy part of -PRON- remain
chapter_82	nevertheless -PRON- may be deem a sort of involuntary whaleman at any rate the whale catch -PRON- if -PRON- do not the whale
chapter_82	if -PRON- claim the demigod then why not the prophet
chapter_83	reference be make to the historical story of jonah and the whale in the precede chapter
chapter_83	but to this bishop jebb 's anticipative answer be ready
chapter_83	nor have there be want learn exegetist who have opine that the whale mention in the book of jonah merely mean a life preserver an inflated bag of wind which the endangered prophet swim to and so be save from a watery doom
chapter_84	nor be -PRON- to be doubt that as such a procedure can do no harm -PRON- may possibly be of no contemptible advantage consider that oil and water be hostile that oil be a slide thing and that the object in view be to make the boat slide bravely
chapter_84	-PRON- be only indispensable with an inveterate run whale -PRON- grand fact and feature be the wonderful distance to which the long lance be accurately dart from a violently rock jerk boat under extreme headway
chapter_84	
chapter_85	say -PRON- stay eleven minute and jet seventy time that is respire seventy breath then whenever -PRON- rise again -PRON- will be sure to have -PRON- seventy breath over again to a minute
chapter_85	not so much thy skill then o hunter as the great necessity that strike the victory to thee
chapter_85	sure -PRON- be nevertheless that the sperm whale have no proper olfactorie
chapter_85	no rose no violet no cologne water in the sea
chapter_85	but the question return whether this gas pipe be also a water pipe in other word whether the spout of the sperm whale be the mere vapour of the exhaled breath or whether that exhale breath be mixed with water take in at the mouth and discharge through the spiracle
chapter_85	the central body of -PRON- be hide in the snowy sparkle mist envelop -PRON- and how can -PRON- certainly tell whether any water fall from -PRON- when always when -PRON- be close enough to a whale to get a close view of -PRON- spout -PRON- be in a prodigious commotion the water cascade all around -PRON-
chapter_85	-PRON- will not do for -PRON- to be peer into -PRON- and put -PRON- face in -PRON-
chapter_86	the compact round body of -PRON- root expand into two broad firm flat palm or fluke gradually shoal away to less than an inch in thickness
chapter_86	scroll wise coil forwards beneath the body and then rapidly spring backwards
chapter_86	third -PRON- can not demonstrate -PRON- but -PRON- seem to -PRON- that in the whale the sense of touch be concentrate in the tail for in this respect there be a delicacy in -PRON- only equal by the daintiness of the elephant 's trunk
chapter_86	nor be there want other motion of the whale in -PRON- general body full of strangeness and unaccountable to -PRON- most experienced assailant
chapter_87	but how now in this zone quest do ahab touch no land
chapter_87	for a long time now the circus run sun have race within -PRON- fiery ring and need no sustenance but what be in -PRON-
chapter_87	unlike the straight perpendicular twin jet of the right whale which divide at top fall over in two branch like the cleft droop bough of a willow the single forward slant spout of the sperm whale present a thick curl bush of white mist continually rise and fall away to leeward
chapter_87	as march army approach an unfriendly defile in the mountain accelerate -PRON- march all eagerness to place that perilous passage in -PRON- rear and once more expand in comparative security upon the plain even so do this vast fleet of whale now seem hurry forward through the strait gradually contract the wing of -PRON- semicircle and swim on in one solid but still crescentic centre
chapter_87	so with stun sail pile on stun sail -PRON- sail along drive these leviathan before -PRON- when of a sudden the voice of tashtego be hear loudly direct attention to something in -PRON- wake
chapter_87	and when -PRON- glance upon the green wall of the watery defile in which the ship be then sailing and bethink -PRON- that through that gate lie the route to -PRON- vengeance and behold how that through that same gate -PRON- be now both chase and be chase to -PRON- deadly end and not only that but a herd of remorseless wild pirate and inhuman atheistical devil be infernally cheer -PRON- on with -PRON- curse when all these conceit have pass through -PRON- brain ahab 's brow be leave gaunt and ribbed like the black sand beach after some stormy tide have be gnaw -PRON- without be able to drag the firm thing from -PRON- place
chapter_87	as be customary in those case the boat at once separate each make for some one lone whale on the outskirt of the shoal
chapter_87	as blind and deaf the whale plunge forward as if by sheer power of speed to rid -PRON- of the iron leech that have fasten to -PRON- as -PRON- thus tear a white gash in the sea on all side menace as -PRON- fly by the crazed creature to and fro rush about -PRON- -PRON- beset boat be like a ship mob by ice isle in a tempest and strive to steer through -PRON- complicated channel and strait know not at what moment -PRON- may be lock in and crush
chapter_87	nor be the oarsman quite idle though -PRON- wont duty be now altogether dispense with
chapter_87	the first and second be successfully dart and -PRON- see the whale staggeringly run off fetter by the enormous sidelong resistance of the towing drugg
chapter_87	-PRON- be a little frisky though as yet -PRON- body seem scarce yet recover from that irksome position -PRON- have so lately occupy in the maternal reticule where tail to head and all ready for the final spring the unborn whale lie bent like a tartar 's bow
chapter_87	fast!--who line -PRON-
chapter_87	who strike
chapter_87	when overflow with mutual esteem the whale salute more hominum
